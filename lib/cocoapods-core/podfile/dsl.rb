module Pod
  class Podfile
    # The methods defined in this file and the order of the methods is
    # relevant for the documentation generated on
    # https://github.com/CocoaPods/guides.cocoapods.org.

    # The Podfile is a specification that describes the dependencies of the
    # targets of one or more Xcode projects.
    #
    # A Podfile can be very simple:
    #
    #     target 'MyApp'
    #     pod 'AFNetworking', '~> 1.0'
    #
    # An example of a more complex Podfile can be:
    #
    #     platform :ios, '9.0'
    #     inhibit_all_warnings!
    #
    #     target 'MyApp' do
    #       pod 'ObjectiveSugar', '~> 0.5'
    #
    #       target 'MyAppTests' do
    #         inherit! :search_paths
    #         pod 'OCMock', '~> 2.0.1'
    #       end
    #     end
    #
    #     post_install do |installer|
    #       installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
    #         puts "#{target.name}"
    #       end
    #     end
    #
    module DSL
      # @!group Root Options
      #   Configuration that applies to the Podfile as a whole.
      #
      #   * `install!` declares the installation method and options to be used
      #     during installation.

      # Specifies the installation method and options to be used when
      # CocoaPods installs this Podfile.
      #
      # The first parameter indicates the installation method to use;
      # next parameters indicate installation options.
      #
      # For now the only accepted installation method is `'cocoapods'`, so
      # you'll always use this value for the first parameter; but more
      # installation methods might be available in future versions.
      #
      # @param   [String] installation_method
      #          the name of the installation strategy.
      #
      # @param   [Hash] options
      #          the installation options.
      #
      # @example Specifying custom CocoaPods installation options
      #
      #          install! 'cocoapods',
      #                   :deterministic_uuids => false,
      #                   :integrate_targets => false

          raise Informative, 'The installation method can only be set at the root level of the Podfile.'
        end

        set_hash_value('installation_method', 'name' => installation_method, 'options' => options)
      end

      # @!group Dependencies
      #   The Podfile specifies the dependencies of each user target.
      #
      #   * `pod` is the way to declare a specific dependency.
      #   * `podspec` provides an easy API for the creation of podspecs.
      #   * `target` is how you scope your dependencies to specific
      #   targets in your Xcode projects.

      #-----------------------------------------------------------------------#

      # Specifies a dependency of the project.
      #
      # A dependency requirement is defined by the name of the Pod and
      # optionally a list of version requirements.
      #
      # When starting out with a project it is likely that you will want to use
      # the latest version of a Pod. If this is the case, simply omit the
      # version requirements.
      #
      #     pod 'SSZipArchive'
      #
      # Later on in the project you may want to freeze to a specific version of
      # a Pod, in which case you can specify that version number.
      #
      #     pod 'Objection', '0.9'
      #
      # Besides no version, or a specific one, it is also possible to use
      # operators:
      #
      # * `= 0.1`    Version 0.1.
      # * `> 0.1`    Any version higher than 0.1.
      # * `>= 0.1`   Version 0.1 and any higher version.
      # * `< 0.1`    Any version lower than 0.1.
      # * `<= 0.1`   Version 0.1 and any lower version.
      # * `~> 0.1.2` Version 0.1.2 and the versions up to 0.2, not including 0.2.
      #              This operator works based on _the last component_ that you
      #              specify in your version requirement. The example is equal to
      #              `>= 0.1.2` combined with `< 0.2.0` and will always match the
      #              latest known version matching your requirements.
      # * `~> 0.1.3-beta.0` Beta and release versions for 0.1.3, release versions
      #              up to 0.2 excluding 0.2. Components separated by a dash (-)
      #              will not be considered for the version requirement.
      #
      # A list of version requirements can be specified for even more fine
      # grained control.
      #
      # For more information, regarding versioning policy, see:
      #

      # * [RubyGems Versioning Policies](http://guides.rubygems.org/patterns/#semantic-versioning)
      #
      # ------
      #
      # ### Build configurations
      #
      # By default dependencies are installed in all the build configurations
      # of the target. For debug purposes or for other reasons, they can be
      # only enabled on a list of build configurations.
      #
      #     pod 'PonyDebugger', :configurations => ['Debug', 'Beta']
      #
      # Alternatively, you can specify to have it included on a single build
      # configuration.
      #
      #     pod 'PonyDebugger', :configuration => 'Debug'
      #
      # Note that transitive dependencies are included in all configurations
      # and you have to manually specify build configurations for them as well in
      # case this is not desired.
      #
      # ------
      #
      # ### Modular Headers
      #
      # If you would like to use modular headers per Pod you can use the
      # following syntax:
      #
      #     pod 'SSZipArchive', :modular_headers => true
      #
      # Additionally, when you use the `use_modular_headers!` attribute,
      # you can exclude a particular Pod from modular headers using the following:
      #
      #     pod 'SSZipArchive', :modular_headers => false
      #
      # ------
      #
      # ### Source
      #
      # By default the sources specified at the global level are searched in the order
      # they are specified for a dependency match. This behaviour can be altered
      # for a specific dependency by specifying the source with the dependency:
      #
      #     pod 'PonyDebugger', :source => 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
      #
      # In this case only the specified source will be searched for the dependency
      # and any global sources ignored.
      #
      # ------
      #
      # ### Subspecs
      #
      # When installing a Pod via its name, it will install all of the
      # default subspecs defined in the podspec.
      #
      # You may install a specific subspec using the following:
      #
      #     pod 'QueryKit/Attribute'
      #
      # You may specify a collection of subspecs to be installed as follows:
      #
      #     pod 'QueryKit', :subspecs => ['Attribute', 'QuerySet']
      #
      # ### Test Specs
      #
      # Test specs can be optionally included via the `:testspecs` option. By default,
      # none of a Pod's test specs are included.
      #
      # You may specify a list of test spec names to install using the following:
      #
      #     pod 'AFNetworking', :testspecs => ['UnitTests', 'SomeOtherTests']
      #
      # The values provided to `:testspecs` correspond to the name provided to the
      # `test_spec` DSL attribute in a Podspec.
      #
      # ------
      #
      # Dependencies can be obtained also from external sources.
      #
      #
      # ### Using the files from a local path.
      #
      #  If you would like to use develop a Pod in tandem with its client
      #  project you can use the `path` option.
      #
      #     pod 'AFNetworking', :path => '~/Documents/AFNetworking'
      #
      #  Using this option CocoaPods will assume the given folder to be the
      #  root of the Pod and will link the files directly from there in the
      #  Pods project. This means that your edits will persist to CocoaPods
      #  installations.
      #
      #  The referenced folder can be a checkout of your your favourite SCM or
      #  even a git submodule of the current repository.
      #
      #  Note that the `podspec` of the Pod file is expected to be in the
      #  folder.
      #
      #
      # ### From a podspec in the root of a library repository.
      #
      # Sometimes you may want to use the bleeding edge version of a Pod. Or a
      # specific revision. If this is the case, you can specify that with your
      # pod declaration.
      #
      # To use the `master` branch of the repository:
      #
      #     pod 'AFNetworking', :git => 'https://github.com/gowalla/AFNetworking.git'
      #
      #
      # To use a different branch of the repository:
      #
      #     pod 'AFNetworking', :git => 'https://github.com/gowalla/AFNetworking.git', :branch => 'dev'
      #
      #
      # To use a tag of the repository:
      #
      #     pod 'AFNetworking', :git => 'https://github.com/gowalla/AFNetworking.git', :tag => '0.7.0'
      #
      #
      # Or specify a commit:
      #
      #     pod 'AFNetworking', :git => 'https://github.com/gowalla/AFNetworking.git', :commit => '082f8319af'
      #
      # It is important to note, though, that this means that the version will
      # have to satisfy any other dependencies on the Pod by other Pods.
      #
      # The `podspec` file is expected to be in the root of the repository,
      # if this library does not have a `podspec` file in its repository
      # yet, you will have to use one of the approaches outlined in the
      # sections below.
      #
      #
      # ### From a podspec outside a spec repository, for a library without podspec.
      #
      # If a podspec is available from another source outside of the libraryâ€™s
      # repository. Consider, for instance, a podspec available via HTTP:
      #
      #     pod 'JSONKit', :podspec => 'https://example.com/JSONKit.podspec'
      #
      #
      # @note       This method allow a nil name and the raises to be more
      #             informative.
      #
      # @return     [void]
      #
      def pod(name = nil, *requirements)
        unless name
          raise StandardError, 'A dependency requires a name.'
        end

        current_target_definition.store_pod(name, *requirements)
      end

      # Use just the dependencies of a Pod defined in the given podspec file.
      # If no arguments are passed the first podspec in the root of the Podfile
      # is used. It is intended to be used by the project of a library. Note:
      # this does not include the sources derived from the podspec just the
      # CocoaPods infrastructure.
      #
      # @example
      #   podspec
      #
      # @example
      #   podspec :name => 'QuickDialog'
      #
      # @example
      #   podspec :path => '/Documents/PrettyKit/PrettyKit.podspec'
      #
      # @param    [Hash {Symbol=>String}] options
      #           the path where to load the {Specification}. If not provided

      #           platform of the target definition.
      #
      #
      # @note     This method requires that the Podfile has a non nil value for

      # @!group Target configuration
      #   These settings are used to control the CocoaPods generated project.
      #
      #   This starts out simply with stating what `platform` you are working
      #   on. `xcodeproj` allows you to state specifically which project to
      #   link with.

      #-----------------------------------------------------------------------#

      # Specifies the platform for which a static library should be built.
      #
      # CocoaPods provides a default deployment target if one is not specified.
      # The current default values are `4.3` for iOS, `10.6` for OS X, `9.0` for tvOS
      # and `2.0` for watchOS.
      #
      # If the deployment target requires it (iOS < `4.3`), `armv6`
      # architecture will be added to `ARCHS`.
      #
      # @param    [Symbol] name
      #           the name of platform, can be either `:osx` for OS X, `:ios`
      #           for iOS, `:tvos` for tvOS, or `:watchos` for watchOS.
      #
      # @param    [String, Version] target
      #           The optional deployment.  If not provided a default value
      #           according to the platform name will be assigned.
      #
      # @example  Specifying the platform
      #
      #           platform :ios, '4.0'

      # library should be linked with.

      # If none of the target definitions specify an explicit project
      # and there is only **one** project in the same directory as the Podfile
      # then that project will be used.
      #
      # It is possible also to specify whether the build settings of your
      # custom build configurations should be modelled after the release or
      # the debug presets. To do so you need to specify a hash where the name
      # of each build configuration is associated to either `:release` or

      #           a hash where the keys are the name of the build
      #           configurations in your Xcode project and the values are
      #           Symbols that specify if the configuration should be based on
      #           the `:debug` or `:release` configuration. If no explicit
      #           mapping is specified for a configuration in your project, it
      #           will default to `:release`.

      # @example  Specifying the user project
