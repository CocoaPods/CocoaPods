    #
    # A dependency requirement is defined by the name of the Pod and _optionally_
    # a list of version requirements.

    # When starting out with a project it is likely that you will want to use the
    # latest version of a Pod. If this is the case, simply omit the version
    # requirements.

    #   dependency 'SSZipArchive'

    # Later on in the project you may want to freeze to a specific version of a
    # Pod, in which case you can specify that version number.

    #   dependency 'Objection', '0.9'
    #
    #
    # Besides no version, or a specific one, it is also possible to use operators:
    #
    # * `> 0.1`    Any version higher than 0.1
    # * `>= 0.1`   Version 0.1 and any higher version
    # * `< 0.1`    Any version lower than 0.1
    # * `<= 0.1`   Version 0.1 and any lower version
    # * `~> 0.1.2` Version 0.1.2 and the versions upto 0.2, not including 0.2
    #
    #
    # Finally, a list of version requirements can be specified for even more fine
    # grained control.

    # ## Dependency on a library, outside those available in a spec repo.
    #
    # ### From a podspec in the root of a library repo.
    #
    # Sometimes you may want to use the bleeding edge version of a Pod. Or a
    # specific revision. If this is the case, you can specify that with your
    # dependency declaration.
    #
    #
    # To use the `master` branch of the repo:
    #
    #   dependency 'TTTFormatterKit', :git => 'https://github.com/gowalla/AFNetworking.git'
    #
    #
    # Or specify a commit:
    #
    #   dependency 'TTTFormatterKit', :git => 'https://github.com/gowalla/AFNetworking.git', :commit => '082f8319af'
    #
    #
    # It is important to note, though, that this means that the version will
    # have to satisfy any other dependencies on the Pod by other Pods.
    #
    #
    # The `podspec` file is expected to be in the root of the repo, if this
    # library does not have a `podspec` file in its repo yet, you will have to
    # use one of the approaches outlined in the sections below.
    #
    #
    # ### From a podspec outside a spec repo, for a library without podspec.
    #
    # If a podspec is available from another source outside of the libraryâ€™s
    # repo. Consider, for instance, a podpsec available via HTTP:
    #
    #   dependency 'JSONKit', :podspec => 'https://raw.github.com/gist/1346394/1d26570f68ca27377a27430c65841a0880395d72/JSONKit.podspec'
    #
    #
    # ### For a library without any available podspec
    #
    # Finally, if no man alive has created a podspec, for the library you want
    # to use, yet, you will have to specify the library yourself.
    #
    #
    # When you omit arguments and pass a block to `dependency`, an instance of
    # Pod::Specification is yielded to the block. This is the same class which
    # is normally used to specify a Pod.
    #
    #   dependency do |spec|
    #     spec.name         = 'JSONKit'
    #     spec.version      = '1.4'
    #     spec.source       = { :git => 'https://github.com/johnezang/JSONKit.git', :tag => 'v1.4' }
    #     spec.source_files = 'JSONKit.*'
    #   end

    # which produces the `libPods.a` file. The second and third are the `:debug`
    # and `:test` ones, which produce the `libPods-debug.a` and `libPods-test.a`
    # files.
    #
    # The `:default` target has only one dependency (ASIHTTPRequest), whereas the
    # `:debug` target has two (ASIHTTPRequest, SSZipArchive). The `:test` target,
    # however, is an exclusive target which means it will only have one
    # dependency (JSONKit).
