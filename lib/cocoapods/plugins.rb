module Pod

  # Simple hook system for plugins.
  #
  # Plugins can register blocks for hooks with the given name.
  # The blocks, to prevent compatibility issues, will receive
  # one and only one argument: a hash which can include one or
  # more keys.
  #
  # The implicipt promise of the plugin system is not to remove
  # hooks and not remove keys from the options hash (honoured
  # strictly from version 1.0).
  #
  # The supported hook names are:
  #
  # - post_install: Called after CocoaPods completed the installation and has
  #   written all files to disk (if plugins want to modify the projet they need
  #   to open it). Receives the complete list of the specifications.
