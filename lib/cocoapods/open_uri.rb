  # Whether {#open} should follow a redirect.

  # This test is intended to forbid a redirection from http://... to
  # file:///etc/passwd, file:///dev/zero, etc.  CVE-2011-1521
  # https to http redirect is also forbidden intentionally.
  # It avoids sending secure cookie or referrer by non-secure HTTP protocol.
  # (RFC 2109 4.3.1, RFC 2965 3.3, RFC 2616 15.1.3)
  # However this is ad hoc.  It should be extensible/configurable.
