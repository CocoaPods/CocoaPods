module Pod

  # A {LocalPod} interfaces one or more specifications belonging to one pod
  # (a library) and their concrete instance in the file system.
  #
  # The {LocalPod} is responsible for orchestrating the activated
  # specifications of a single pod. Specifically, it keeps track of the
  # activated specifications and handles issues related to duplicates
  # files.
  # Inheritance logic belongs to the {Specification} class.
  #
  # The activated specifications are used to compute the paths that can be
  # safely cleaned by the pod.
  #
  # @example
  #     pod = LocalPod.new 'RestKit/Networking'
  #     pod.add_specification 'RestKit/UI'
  #
  # @note
  #   Unless otherwise specified in the name of the method the {LocalPod}
  #   returns absolute paths.
