Downloading dependencies

-> Installing JSONKit 1.4 (was 1.4)
 > Git download
 > Git download
     $ GIT_BIN clone https://github.com/johnezang/JSONKit.git ROOT/tmp/update_selected/Pods/JSONKit --single-branch --depth 1 --branch v1.4
     Cloning into 'ROOT/tmp/update_selected/Pods/JSONKit'...
     Note: checking out '99930114548f9cedc8070a3bd4d9a217adc218ca'.
     
     You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
     changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
     state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.
     
     If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
     do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example:
     
       git checkout -b new_branch_name
     

-> Installing Reachability 3.1.1 (was 3.0.0)
