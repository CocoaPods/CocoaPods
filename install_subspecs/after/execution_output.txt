Integrating client project

[!] From now on use `SampleApp.xcworkspace`.

Integrating Pod target `Pods-OS X App-PodTest` into aggregate target Pods-OS X App of project `SampleApp.xcodeproj`.

Integrating Pod target `Pods-iOS App-PodTest` into aggregate target Pods-iOS App of project `SampleApp.xcodeproj`.

[!] The `iOS App [Release]` target overrides the `OTHER_CFLAGS` build setting defined in `Pods/Pods-iOS App.Release.xcconfig'.This can lead to problems with the CocoaPods installation
    - Use the `$(inherited)` flag, or
    - Remove the build settings from the target.
