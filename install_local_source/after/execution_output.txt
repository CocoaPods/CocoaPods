Integrating client project

[!] From now on use `SampleApp.xcworkspace`.

Integrating target `Pods` (`SampleApp.xcodeproj` project)

[!] The `:local` option of the Podfile has been renamed to `:path` and it is deprecated.

[!] The `iOS App [Release]` target overrides the `OTHER_CFLAGS` build setting defined in `Pods/Target Support Files/Pods/Pods.release.xcconfig'. This can lead to problems with the CocoaPods installation
    - Use the `$(inherited)` flag, or
    - Remove the build settings from the target.
