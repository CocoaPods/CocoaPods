WARNING: Please read https://blog.cocoapods.org/CocoaPods-Support-Plans/
new issues are, for the most part, not read or responded to by the development team

WARNING: Please do not file issues for CocoaPods with projects 
that use React Native or Flutter. Please remove React Native or Flutter
in your sample app in order to properly demonstrate an issue with CocoaPods itself.

The integration between CocoaPods and React Native or Flutter 
makes it very difficult for us to diagnose and fix issues.

Issues with React Native or Flutter will be closed.

Please file React Native issues at https://github.com/facebook/react-native
and Flutter issues at https://github.com/flutter/flutter.

ℹ Please fill out this template when filing an issue.
All lines beginning with an ℹ symbol instruct you with

Before you start, are you using the latest CocoaPods release?
A lot changes with Xcode releases that are not backwards compatible.

Not an issue about the CocoaPods command line app? Please file an issue in the appropriate repo - https://github.com/CocoaPods
Issues are for feature requests, and bugs; questions should go to Stack Overflow

Issue with Nanaimo not loading:
Please run `[sudo] gem uninstall nanaimo` and remove all but the latest version.

Issues with `pod search`? Try deleting your cache `rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/CocoaPods`first.
