## Master
[CocoaPods](https://github.com/jverkoey/CocoaPods/compare/0.29.0...master)

###### Enhancements

* Radically reduce first run pod setup bandwidth by creating a shallow clone of
  the ‘master’ repo by default. Use the `--no-shallow` option to perform a full
  clone instead.  
  [Jeff Verkoeyen](https://github.com/jverkoey)
  [#1803](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/pull/1803)

* Improves the error message when searching with an invalid regular expression.  
  [Kyle Fuller](https://github.com/kylef)

* Improves `pod init` to save Xcode project file in Podfile when one was supplied.  
  [Kyle Fuller](https://github.com/kylef)

###### Bug Fixes

* Fixes a bug with `pod repo remove` silently handling permission errors.

[CocoaPods](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/compare/0.28.0...0.29.0)
• [CocoaPods-core](https://github.com/CocoaPods/Core/compare/0.28.0...0.29.0)
• [cocoapods-downloader](https://github.com/CocoaPods/cocoapods-downloader/compare/0.2.0...0.3.0)

###### Breaking

* The command `podfile_info` is now a plugin offered by CocoaPods.
  As a result, the command has been removed from CocoaPods.  
  [Joshua Kalpin](https://github.com/Kapin)
  [#1589](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/1589)

* JSON has been adopted as the format to store specifications. As a result
  the `pod ipc spec` command returns a JSON representation and the YAML
  specifications are not supported anymore. JSON specifications adopt the
  `.podspec.json` extension.
  [Fabio Pelosin](https://github.com/irrationalfab)
  [#1568](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/pull/1568)

###### Enhancements

* Introduced `pod try` the easiest way to test the example project of a pod.  
  [Fabio Pelosin](https://github.com/irrationalfab)
  [#1568](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/pull/1568)

* Pod headers are now provided to the user target as a system
  header. This means that any warnings in a Pod's code will show
  under its target in Xcode's build navigator, and never under the
  user target.  
  [Swizzlr](https://github.com/swizzlr)
  [#1596](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/pull/1596)

* Support LZMA2 compressed tarballs in the downloader.  
  [Kyle Fuller](https://github.com/kylef)
  [cocoapods-downloader#5](https://github.com/CocoaPods/cocoapods-downloader/pull/5)

* Add Bazaar support for installing directly from a repo.  
  [Fred McCann](https://github.com/fmccann)
  [#1632](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/pull/1632)

* The `pod search <query>` command now supports regular expressions
  for the query parameter when searching using the option `--full`.  
  [Florian Hanke](https://github.com/floere)
  [#1643](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/pull/1643)

* Pod lib lint now accepts multiple podspecs in the same folder.  
  [kra Larivain/OpenTable](https://github.com/opentable)
  [#1635](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/pull/1635)

* The `pod push` command will now silently test the upcoming CocoaPods trunk
  service. The service is only tested when pushing to the master repo and the
  test doesn't affect the normal workflow.  
  [Fabio Pelosin](https://github.com/irrationalfab)

* The `pod search <query>` command now supports searching on cocoapods.org
  when searching using the option `--web`. Options `--ios` and `--osx` are
  fully supported.
  [Florian Hanke](https://github.com/floere)
  [#1643](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/pull/1682)

* The `pod search <query>` command now supports multiword queries when using
  the `--web` option.
  [Florian Hanke](https://github.com/floere)
  [#1643](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/pull/1682)

###### Bug Fixes

* Fixed a bug which resulted in `pod lib lint` not being able to find the
  headers.  
  [Fabio Pelosin](https://github.com/irrationalfab)
  [#1566](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/1566)

* Fixed the developer frameworks search paths so that
  `$(SDKROOT)/Developer/Library/Frameworks` is used for iOS and
  `$(DEVELOPER_LIBRARY_DIR)/Frameworks` is used for OS X.  
  [Kevin Wales](https://github.com/kwales)
  [#1562](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/pull/1562)

* When updating the pod repos, repositories with unreachable remotes
  are now ignored. This fixes an issue with certain private repositories.  
  [Joshua Kalpin](https://github.com/Kapin)
  [#1595](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/pull/1595)
  [#1571](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/1571)

* The linter will now display an error if a Pod's name contains whitespace.  
  [Joshua Kalpin](https://github.com/Kapin)
  [Core#39](https://github.com/CocoaPods/Core/pull/39)
  [#1610](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/1610)
  
* Having the silent flag enabled in the config will no longer cause issues
  with `pod search`. In addition, the flag `--silent` is no longer supported
  for the command.  
  [Joshua Kalpin](https://github.com/Kapin)
  [#1627](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/pull/1627)

* The linter will now display an error if a framework ends with `.framework`
  (i.e. `QuartzCore.framework`).  
  [Joshua Kalpin](https://github.com/Kapin)
  [#1331](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/1336)
  [Core#45](https://github.com/CocoaPods/Core/pull/45)

* The linter will now display an error if a library ends with `.a` or `.dylib`
  (i.e. `z.dylib`). It will also display an error if it begins with `lib`
  (i.e. `libxml`).  
  [Joshua Kalpin](https://github.com/Kapin)
  [Core#44](https://github.com/CocoaPods/Core/issues/44)

* The ARCHS build setting can come back as an array when more than one
  architecture is specified.  
  [Carson McDonald](https://github.com/carsonmcdonald)
  [#1628](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/1628)

* Fixed all issues caused by `/tmp` being a symlink to `/private/tmp`. 
  This affected mostly `pod lib lint`, causing it to fail when the 
  Pod used `prefix_header_*` or when the pod headers imported headers 
  using the namespaced syntax (e.g. `#import <MyPod/Header.h>`).  
  [kra Larivain/OpenTable](https://github.com/opentable)
  [#1514](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/pull/1514)

* Fixed an incorrect path being used in the example app Podfile generated by
  `pod lib create`.

• [CLAide](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CLAide/compare/0.3.2...0.4.0)

###### Enhancements

* CLAide now supports gem plugins. An example CocoaPods plugin can be found at
  [open\_pod\_bay](https://github.com/leshill/open_pod_bay).

  As of yet there are no promises made yet on the APIs, so try to fail as
  gracefully as possible in case a CocoaPods update breaks your usage. In these
  cases, also please let us know what you would need, so we can take this into
  account when we do finalize APIs.

  [#959](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/959)

###### Bug Fixes

* Compiling `xcassets` with `actool` now uses `UNLOCALIZED_RESOURCES_FOLDER_PATH`
  instead of `PRODUCT_NAME.WRAPPER_EXTENSION` as output directory as it is more
  accurate and allows the project to overwrite `WRAPPER_NAME`.  
  [Marc Knaup](https://github.com/fluidsonic)
  [#1556](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/pull/1556)

* Added a condition to avoid compiling xcassets when `WRAPPER_EXTENSION`
  is undefined, as it would be in the case of static libraries. This prevents
  trying to copy the compiled files to a directory that does not exist.  
  [Noah McCann](https://github.com/nmccann)
  [#1521](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/pull/1521)

* Added additional condition to check if `actool` is available when compiling
  `xcassets`. This prevents build failures of Xcode 5 projects on Travis CI (or
  lower Xcode versions).  
  [Michal Konturek](https://github.com/michalkonturek)
  [#1511](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/pull/1511)

* Added a condition to properly handle universal or mac apps when compiling
  xcassets. This prevents build errors in the xcassets compilation stage
  particularly when using xctool to build.  
  [Ryan Marsh](https://github.com/ryanwmarsh)
  [#1594](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/pull/1594)

* Vendored Libraries now correctly affect whether a podspec is considered empty.  
  [Joshua Kalpin](https://github.com/Kapin)
  [Core#38](https://github.com/CocoaPods/Core/pull/38)

* Vendored Libraries and Vendored Frameworks now have their paths validated correctly.  
  [Joshua Kalpin](https://github.com/Kapin)
  [#1567](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/pull/1567)

* Gists are now correctly accepted with https.  
  [Joshua Kalpin](https://github.com/Kapin)
  [Core#38](https://github.com/CocoaPods/Core/pull/38)

* The `pod push` command is now more specific about the branch it pushes to.  
  [orta](http://orta.github.io)
  [#1561](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/pull/1561)

* Dtrace files are now properly left unflagged when installing, regardless of configuration.  
  [Swizzlr](https://github.com/swizzlr)
  [#1560](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/pull/1560)

* Users are now warned if their terminal encoding is not UTF-8. This fixes an issue
  with a small percentage of pod names that are incompatible with ASCII.

• [cocoapods-core](https://github.com/CocoaPods/Core/compare/0.26.2...0.27.1)
• [Xcodeproj](https://github.com/CocoaPods/Xcodeproj/compare/0.13.0...0.14.0)

###### Enhancements

* The xcodeproj gem now comes bundled with prebuilt binaries for the Ruby
  versions that come with OS X 10.8 and 10.9. Users now no longer need to
  install the Xcode Command Line Tools or deal with the Ruby C header location.  
  [Eloy Durán](https://github.com/alloy)
  [Xcodeproj#88](https://github.com/CocoaPods/Xcodeproj/issues/88)

* Targets passed to the `link_with` method of the Podfile DSL no longer need
  to be explicitly passed as an array. `link_with ['target1', 'target2']` can
  now be written as `link_with 'target1', 'target2'`.  
  [Adam Sharp](https://github.com/sharplet)
  [Core#30](https://github.com/CocoaPods/Core/pull/30)

* The copy resources script now compiles xcassets resources.  
  [Ulrik Damm](https://github.com/ulrikdamm)
  [#1427](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/pull/1427)

* `pod repo` now support a `remove ['repo_name']` command.  
  [Joshua Kalpin](https://github.com/Kapin)
  [#1493](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/1493)
  [#1484](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/1484)

###### Bug Fixes

* The architecture is now set in the build settings of the user build
  configurations.  
  [Fabio Pelosin](https://github.com/irrationalfab)
  [#1450](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/1462)
  [#1462](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/1462)

* Fixed a crash related to CocoaPods being unable to resolve an unique build
  setting of an user target with custom build configurations.  
  [Fabio Pelosin](https://github.com/irrationalfab)
  [#1462](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/1462)
  [#1463](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/1463)
  [#1457](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/1457)

* Fixed a defect which prevented subspecs from being dependant on a pod with a
  name closely matching the name of one of the subspec's parents.  
  [Noah McCann](https://github.com/nmccann)
  [#29](https://github.com/CocoaPods/Core/pull/29)

* The developer dir relative to the SDK is not added anymore if testing 
  frameworks are detected in OS X targets, as it doesn't exists, avoiding the
  presentation of the relative warning in Xcode.  
  [Fabio Pelosin](https://github.com/irrationalfab)

###### Bug Fixes

* Fixed a crash which was causing a failure in `pod lib create` if the name of
  the Pod included spaces. As spaces are not supported now this is gracefully
  handled with an informative message.  
  [Kyle Fuller](https://github.com/kylef)
  [#1456](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/1456)

* If an user target doesn't specify an architecture the value specified for the
  project is used in CocoaPods targets.  
  [Fabio Pelosin](https://github.com/irrationalfab)
  [#1450](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/1450)

• [Xcodeproj](https://github.com/CocoaPods/Xcodeproj/compare/0.11.1...0.12.0)

###### Enhancements

* CocoaPods now creates and hides the schemes of its targets after every
  installation. The schemes are not shared because the flag which keeps track
  whether they should be visible is a user only flag. The schemes are still
  present and to debug a single Pod it is possible to make its scheme visible
  in the Schemes manager of Xcode. This is rarely needed though because the
  user targets trigger the compilation of the Pod targets.  
  [Fabio Pelosin](https://github.com/irrationalfab)
  [#1185](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/pull/1185)

* Installations which don't integrate a user target (lint subcommands and
  `--no-integrate` option) now set the architecture of OS X Pod targets to
  `$(ARCHS_STANDARD_64_BIT)` (Xcode 4 default value for new targets). This
  fixes lint issues with Xcode 4.  
  [Fabio Pelosin](https://github.com/irrationalfab)
  [#1185](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/pull/1185)

* Further improvements to the organization of the Pods project  

  - The project is now is sorted by name with groups at the bottom.
  - Source files are now stored in the root group of the spec, subspecs are not
    stored in a `Subspec` group anymore and the products of the Pods all are
    stored in the products group of the project.
  - The frameworks are referenced relative to the Developer directory and
    namespaced per platform.

  [#1389](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/pull/1389)
  [#1420](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/pull/1420)

* Added the `documentation_url` DSL attribute to the specifications.  
  [Fabio Pelosin](https://github.com/irrationalfab)
  [#1273](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/pull/1273)

###### Bug Fixes

* The search paths of vendored frameworks and libraries now are always
  specified relatively.  
  [Fabio Pelosin](https://github.com/irrationalfab)
  [#1405](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/pull/1405)

* Fix an issue where CocoaPods would fail to work when used with an older
  version of the Active Support gem. This fix raises the dependency version to
  the earliest compatible version of Active Support.  
  [Kyle Fuller](https://github.com/kylef)
  [#1407](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/1407)

* CocoaPods will not attempt to load anymore all the version of a specification
  preventing crashes if those are incompatible.

• [Xcodeproj](https://github.com/CocoaPods/Xcodeproj/compare/0.10.1...0.11.0)

###### Enhancements

* Added support for Xcode 5.

  The generated Pods Xcode project is now compatible with `arm64` projects and
  is updated to use Xcode 5’s default settings removing all warnings.

  **NOTE to users migrating projects from Xcode 4, or are still using Xcode 4:**
  1. The Pods Xcode project now sets the `ONLY_ACTIVE_ARCH` build setting to
     `YES` in the `Debug` configuration. You _will_ have to set the same on your
     project/target, otherwise the build _will_ fail.
  2. Ensure your project/target has an `ARCHS` value set, otherwise the build
     _will_ fail.
  3. When building a **iOS** project from the command-line, with the `xcodebuild`
     tool that comes with Xcode 4, you’ll need to completely disable this setting
     by appending to your build command: `ONLY_ACTIVE_ARCH=NO`.

  [#1352](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/pull/1352)

* Speed up project generation in `pod install` and `pod update`.

* The pre and post install hooks that have been deprecated now include the name
  and version of the spec that’s using them.

###### Bug Fixes

* Only create a single resource bundle for all targets. Prior to this change a
  resource bundle included into multiple targets within the project would create
  duplicately named targets in the Pods Xcode project, causing duplicately named
  Schemes to be created on each invocation of `pod install`. All targets that
  reference a given resource bundle now have dependencies on a single common
  target.

  [Blake Watters](https://github.com/blakewatters)
  [#1338](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/1338)

* Solved outstanding issues with CocoaPods resource bundles and Archive builds:
  1. The rsync task copies symlinks into the App Bundle, producing an invalid
     app. This change add `--copy-links` to the rsync invocation to ensure the
     target files are copied rather than the symlink.
  2. The Copy Resources script uses `TARGET_BUILD_DIR` which points to the App
     Archiving folder during an Archive action. Switching to
     `BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR` instead ensures that the path is correct for all
     actions and configurations.

• [cocoapods-downloader](https://github.com/CocoaPods/cocoapods-downloader/compare/0.1.1...0.2.0)

###### Enhancements

* Added `pod init` command which generates a Podfile according to the
  targets of the project stored in the working directory and to the templates
  stored in the `~/.cocoapods/templates` folder. Two templates are supported: 
    - the `Podfile.default` template for regular targets.
    - and the `Podfile.test` template for test targets.

  [#1106](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/1106)
  [#1045](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/1045)

* CocoaPods will now leverage the [xcproj](https://github.com/0xced/xcproj)
  command line tool if available in the path of the user to touch saved
  projects. This will result in projects being serialized in the exact format
  used by Xcode eliminating merge conflicts and other related issues. To learn
  more about how to install xcproj see its
  [readme](https://github.com/0xced/xcproj).
  [Cédric Luthi](https://github.com/0xced)
  [#1275](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/1275)

* Rationalized and cleaned up Pods project group structure and path specification.

* Create all necessary build configurations for *Pods.xcodeproj* at the project level. If the user’s project has more than just *Debug* and *Release* build configurations, they may be explicitly specified in the Podfile:  
`xcodeproj 'MyApp', 'App Store' => :release, 'Debug' => :debug, 'Release' => :release`  
  If build configurations aren’t specified in the Podfile then they will be automatically picked from the user’s project in *Release* mode.  
  These changes will ensure that the `libPods.a` static library is not stripped for all configurations, as explained in [#1217](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/pull/1217).  
  [Cédric Luthi](https://github.com/0xced)  
  [#1294](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/1294)

* Added basic support for Bazaar repositories.

  [cocoapods-downloader#4](https://github.com/CocoaPods/cocoapods-downloader/pull/4)

###### Bug Fixes

* Fixed crash in `pod spec cat`.

* Use the `TARGET_BUILD_DIR` environment variable for installing resource bundles.  
  [Cédric Luthi](https://github.com/0xced)  
  [#1268](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/1268)

###### Enhancements

* Added `prepare_command` attribute to Specification DSL. The prepare command
  will replace the `pre_install` hook. The `post_install` hook has also been
  deprecated.
  [#1247](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/1247)

  The reason we provided Ruby hooks at first, was because we wanted to offer
  the option to make any required configuration possible. By now, however, we
  have a pretty good idea of the use-cases and are therefore locking down the
  freedom that was once available. In turn, we’re adding attributes that can
  replace the most common use-cases. _(See the enhancements directly following
  this entry for more info)._

  The second reason we need to lock this down is because this is the last
  remaining obstacle to fully serialize specifications, which we need in order
  to move to a ‘spec push’ web-service in the future.

* Added `resource_bundles` attribute to the Specification DSL.  
  [#743](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/743)

###### Enhancements

* Pods are now built in dedicated targets. This enhancement isolates the build
  environment of each Pod from other ones eliminating pollution issues. It also
  introduces an important architectural improvement which lays the foundation
  for the upcoming CocoaPods features. Stay tuned! This feature has been
  implemented by [Jeremy Slater](https://github.com/jasl8r).

###### Bug fixes

* Made sandbox-pod executable visible as it wasn't correctly configured in the
  gemspec.
* Made sandbox-pod executable actually work when installed as a gem. (In which
  case every executable is wrapped in a wrapper bin script and the DATA constant
  can no longer be used.)
* Required CLAide 0.3.2 as 0.3.0 didn't include all the files in the gemspec

###### Enhancements

* Introduces an experimental sandbox feature.
  [#939](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/939)

  Let’s face it, even though we have a great community that spends an amazing
  amount of time on curating the specifications, the internet can be a hostile
  place and the community is growing too large to take a naive approach any
  longer.

  As such, we have started leveraging OS X’s sandbox facilities to disallow
  unsanctioned operations. This is still very experimental and therefore has to
  be used explicitely, for now, but that does **not** mean we don’t want you to
  start using it and **report issues**.

  To use the sandbox, simply use the `sandbox-pod` command instead. E.g.:

        $ sandbox-pod install

  In case of issues, be sure to check `/var/log/system.log` for ‘deny’ messages.
  For instance, here’s an example where the sandbox denies read access to `/`:

        May 16 00:23:35 Khaos kernel[0]: Sandbox: ruby(98430) deny file-read-data /

  **NOTE**: _The above example is actually one that we know of. We’re not sure
  yet which process causes this, but there shouldn’t be a need for any process
  to read data from the root path anyways._

  **NOTE 2**: _At the moment the sandbox is not compatible with the `:path` option
  when referencing Pods that are not stored within the directory of the Podfile._

* The naked `pod` command now defaults to `pod install`.
  [#958](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/958)

* CocoaPods will look for the Podfile in the ancestors paths if one is
  not available in the working directory.
  [#940](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/940)

* Documentation generation has been removed from CocoaPods as it graduated
  to CocoaDocs. This decision was taken because CocoaDocs is a much better
  solution which doesn't clutter Xcode's docsets while still allowing
  access to the docsets with Xcode and with Dash. Removing this feature
  keeps the installer leaner and easier to develop and paves the way for the
  upcoming sandbox. Private pods can use pre install hook to generate the
  documentation. If there will be enough demand this feature might be
  reintegrated as plugin (see
  [#1037](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/1037)).

* Improved performance of the copy resources script and thus build time of
  the integrated targets. Contribution by [@onato](https://github.com/onato)
  [#1050](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/1050).

* The changelog for the current version is printed after CocoaPods is
  installed/updated.
  [#853](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/853).


###### Bug fixes

* Inheriting `inhibit_warnings` per pod is now working
  [#1032](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/1032)
* Fix copy resources script for iOS < 6 and OS X < 10.8 by removing the
  `--reference-external-strings-file`
  flag. [#1030](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/pull/1030)
* Fixed issues with the `:head` option of the Podfile.

###### Enhancements

* Compile time introspection. Macro definitions which allow to inspect the
  installed Pods and their version have been introduced in the build
  environment of the Pod libraries
  ([example](https://gist.github.com/irrationalfab/5348551)).
* CocoaPods now defines the `COCOAPODS=1` macro in the Pod and the Client
  targets. This is useful for libraries which conditionally expose interfaces.
  [#903](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/903)

  DSL.
  [#998](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/998)

  the minimum deployment target of the Pods libraries.
  [#556](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/556)
* Added `pod podfile-info` command. Shows list of used Pods and their info
  in a project or supplied Podfile.
  Options: `--all` - with dependencies. `--md` - in Markdown.
  [#855](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/855)
* Added `pod help` command. You can still use the old format
  with --help flag.
  [#957](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/pull/957)
* Restored support for Podfiles named `CocoaPods.podfile`. Moreover, the
  experimental YAML format of the Podfile now is associated with files named
  `CocoaPods.podfile.yaml`.

[CocoaPods](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/compare/0.16.4...0.17.0.rc1)
• [Xcodeproj](https://github.com/CocoaPods/Xcodeproj/compare/0.4.3...0.5.0)

• [cocoapods-downloader](https://github.com/CocoaPods/cocoapods-downloader)

###### __Notice__

At some point in future the master repo will be switched to the YAML format of
specifications. This means that specifications with hooks (or any other kind of
dynamic logic) will not be accepted. Please let us know if there is need for
other DSL attributes or any other kind of support.

Currently the following specifications fail to load as they depended on the
CocoaPods internals and need to be updated:

- LibComponentLogging-pods/0.0.1/LibComponentLogging-pods.podspec
- RestKit/0.9.3/RestKit.podspec
- Three20/1.0.11/Three20.podspec
- ARAnalytics/1.1/ARAnalytics.podspec

Other specifications, might present compatibility issues for the reasons
presented below.

###### __Breaking__

- Subspecs do **not** inherit the files patterns from the parent spec anymore.
  This feature made the implementation more complicated and was not easy to
  explain to podspecs maintainers. Compatibility can be easily fixed by adding
  a 'Core' subspec.
- Support for inline podspecs has been removed.
- The support for Rake::FileList is being deprecated, in favor of a more
  consistent DSL. Rake::FileList also presented issues because it would access
  the file system as soon as it was converted to an array.
- The hooks architecture has been re-factored and might present
  incompatibilities (please open an issue if appropriate).
- The `requires_arc` attribute default value is transitioning from `false` to
  `true`. In the meanwhile a value is needed to pass the lint.
- Deprecated `copy_header_mapping` hook.
- Deprecated `exclude_header_search_paths` attribute.
- External sources are not supported in the dependencies of specifications
  anymore. Actually they never have been supported, they just happened to work.

###### DSL

- Podfile:
  - It is not needed to specify the platform anymore (unless not integrating)
    as CocoaPods now can infer the platform from the integrated targets.
- Specification:
  - `preferred_dependency` has been renamed to `default_subspec`.
  - Added `exclude_files` attribute.
  - Added `screenshots` attribute.
  - Added default values for attributes like `source_files`.

###### Enhancements

- Released preview [documentation](http://docs.cocoapods.org).
- CocoaPods now has support for working in teams and not committing the Pods
  folder, as it will keep track of the status of the Pods folder.
  [#552](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/552)
- Simplified installation: no specific version of ruby gems is required anymore.
- The workspace is written only if needed greatly reducing the occasions in
  which Xcode asks to revert.
- The Lockfile is sorted reducing the SCM noise.
  [#591](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/591)
- Added Podfile, Frameworks, and Resources to the Pods project.
  [#647](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/647)
  [#588](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/588)
- Adds new subcommand `pod spec cat NAME` to print a spec file to standard output.
- Specification hooks are only called when the specification is installed.
- The `--no-clean` option of the `pod spec lint` command now displays the Pods
  project for inspection.
- It is now possible to specify default values for the configuration in
  `~/.cocoapods/config.yaml` ([default values](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/blob/master/lib/cocoapods/config.rb#L17)).
- CocoaPods now checks the checksums of the installed specifications and
  reinstalls them if needed.
- Support for YAML formats of the Podfile and the Specification.
- Added new command `pod ipc` to provide support for inter process
  communication through YAML formats.
- CocoaPods now detects if the folder of a Pod is empty and reinstalls it.
  [#534](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/534)
- Install hooks and the `prefix_header_contents` attribute are supported in subspecs.
  [#617](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/617)
- Dashes are now supported in the versions of the Pods.
  [#293](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/293)

###### Bug fixes

- CocoaPods is not confused anymore by target definitions with different activated subspec.
  [#535](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/535)
- CocoaPods is not confused anymore by to dependencies from external sources.
  [#548](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/548)
- The git cache will always update against the remote if a tag is requested,
  resolving issues where library maintainers where updating the tag after a
  lint and would be confused by CocoaPods using the cached commit for the tag.
  [#407](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/407)
  [#596](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/596)

###### Bug fixes

- Only flatten tarballs, **not** zipballs, from HTTP sources. A zipball can
  contain single directories in the root that should be preserved, for instance
  a framework bundle. This reverts part of the change in 0.16.1.
  **NOTE** This will break some podspecs that were changed after 0.16.1.
  [#783](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/pull/783)
  [#727](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/727)

###### Bug fixes

- After unpacking source from a HTTP location, move the source into the parent
  dir if the archive contained only one child. This is done to make it
  consistent with how source from other types of locations are described in a
  podspec.
  **NOTE** This might break some podspecs that assumed the incorrect layout.

###### Enhancements

- Improve installation process by preserving the installed versions of Pods
  across installations and machines. A Pod is reinstalled if:
  - the version required in the Podfile changes and becomes incompatible with
    the installed one.

  - the external source changes.
  - the head status changes (from disabled to enabled or vice-versa).
- Introduce `pod update` command that installs the dependencies of the Podfile
  **ignoring** the lockfile `Podfile.lock`.
  [#131](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/131)
- Introduce `pod outdated` command that shows the pods with known updates.
- Add `:local` option for dependencies which will use the source files directly
  from a local directory. This is usually used for libraries that are being
  developed in parallel to the end product (application/library).

  makes it play nicer with SCMs that store metadata in each directory.
  [#245](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/245)
- Now the Podfile is added to the Pods project for convenient editing.

###### Bug fixes

- The git cache now fetches the tags from the remote if it can’t find the
  reference.
- Xcodeproj now builds on 10.6.8 and Travis CI without symlinking headers.
- Only try to install, add source files to the project, and clean a Pod once.
  [#376](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/376)

###### Notes

- External Pods might be reinstalled due to the migration to the new
  `Podfile.lock`.
- The SCM reference of head Pods is not preserved across machines.
- Pods whose inline specification changed are not detected as modified. As a
  workaround, remove their folder stored in `Pods`.
- Pods whose specification changed are not detected as modified. As a
  workaround, remove their folder stored in `Pods`.

- Raise an informative error message when the platform in the `Podfile` is omitted or incorrect. [#403](http://git.io/k5EcUQ)


## 0.9.1

[CocoaPods](http://git.io/_kqAbw)

###### Bug fixes

- CocoaPods 0.9.x needs Xcodeproj 0.3.0.


## 0.9.0

[CocoaPods](http://git.io/kucJQw) • [Xcodeproj](http://git.io/5eLL8g)

###### Enhancements

- Force downloading the ‘bleeding edge’ version of a pod with the `:head` flag. [#392](http://git.io/t_NVRQ)
- Support for weak frameworks. [#263](http://git.io/XZDuog)
- Use double quotes when shelling out. This makes a url like `$HOME/local/lib` work. [#396](http://git.io/DnBzhA)

###### Bug fixes

- Relaxed linter to accepts pod that only specify paths to preserve (like TuneupJS).
- Gender neutralization of podfile documentation. [#384](http://git.io/MAsHXg)
- Exit early when using an old RubyGems version (< 1.4.0). These versions contain subtle bugs
  related to prerelease version comparisons. Unfortunately, OS X >= 10.7 ships with 1.3.6. [#398](http://git.io/Lr7DoA)


## 0.8.0

[CocoaPods](http://git.io/RgMF3w) • [Xcodeproj](http://git.io/KBKE_Q)

###### Breaking change

Syntax change in Podfile: `dependency` has been replaced by `pod`.

``ruby
platform :ios
pod 'JSONKit',      '~> 1.4'
pod 'Reachability', '~> 2.0.4'
``

###### Bug fixes

- Properly quote all paths given to Git.


## 0.7.0

[CocoaPods](http://git.io/Agia6A) • [Xcodeproj](http://git.io/mlqquw)

###### Features

- Added support for branches in git repos.
- Added support for linting remote files, i.e. `pod spec lint http://raw/file.podspec`.
- Improved `Spec create template`.
- The indentation is automatically stripped for podspecs strings.

###### Bug fixes

- The default warnings of Xcode are not overriden anymore.
- Improvements to the detection of the license files.
- Improvements to `pod spec lint`.
- CocoaPods is now case insensitive.


## 0.6.1

[CocoaPods](http://git.io/45wFjw) • [Xcodeproj](http://git.io/rRA4XQ)

###### Bug fixes

- Switched to master branch for specs repo.
- Fixed a crash with `pod spec lint` related to `preserve_paths`.
- Fixed a bug that caused subspecs to not inherit the compiler flags of the top level specification.
- Fixed a bug that caused duplication of system framworks.


## 0.6.0

### Link with specific targets

CocoaPods can now integrate all the targets specified in your `Podfile`.

To specify which target, in your Xcode project, a Pods target should be linked
with, use the `link_with` method like so:

``ruby
platform :ios

workspace 'MyWorkspace'

link_with ['MyAppTarget', 'MyOtherAppTarget']
dependency 'JSONKit'

target :test, :exclusive => true do
  xcodeproj 'TestProject', 'Test' => :debug
  link_with 'TestRunnerTarget'
  dependency 'Kiwi'
end
``

_NOTE: As you can see it can take either one target name, or an array of names._

* If no explicit Xcode workspace is specified and only **one** project exists in
the same directory as the Podfile, then the name of that project is used as the
workspace’s name.

* If no explicit Xcode project is specified for a target, it will use the Xcode
project of the parent target. If no target specifies an expicit Xcode project
and there is only **one** project in the same directory as the Podfile then that
project will be used.

* If no explicit target is specified, then the Pods target will be linked with
the first target in your project. So if you only have one target you do not
need to specify the target to link with.

See [#76](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/76) for more info.

Finally, CocoaPods will add build configurations to the Pods project for all
configurations in the other projects in the workspace. By default the
configurations are based on the `Release` configuration, to base them on the
`Debug` configuration you will have to explicitely specify them as can be seen
above in the following line:

```ruby
xcodeproj 'TestProject', 'Test' => :debug
```


### Documentation

CocoaPods will now generate documentation for every library with the
[`appledoc`][5] tool and install it into Xcode’s documentation viewer.

You can customize the settings used like so:

```ruby
s.documentation = { :appledoc => ['--product-name', 'My awesome project!'] }
```

Alternatively, you can specify a URL where an HTML version of the documentation
can be found:

```ruby
s.documentation = { :html => 'http://example.com/docs/index.html' }
```

See [#149](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/149) and
[#151](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/151) for more info.


### Licenses & Documentation

CocoaPods will now generate two 'Acknowledgements' files for each target specified
in your Podfile which contain the License details for each Pod used in that target
(assuming details have been specified in the Pod spec).

There is a markdown file, for general consumption, as well as a property list file
that can be added to a settings bundle for an iOS application.

You don't need to do anything for this to happen, it should just work.

If you're not happy with the default boilerplate text generated for the title, header
and footnotes in the files, it's possible to customise these by overriding the methods
that generate the text in your `Podfile` like this:

```ruby
class ::Pod::Generator::Acknowledgements
  def header_text
    "My custom header text"
  end
end
```

You can even go one step further and customise the text on a per target basis by
checking against the target name, like this:

```ruby
class ::Pod::Generator::Acknowledgements
  def header_text
    if @target_definition.label.end_with?("MyTargetName")
      "Custom header text for MyTargetName"
    else
      "Custom header text for other targets"
    end
  end
end
```

Finally, here's a list of the methods that are available to override:

```ruby
header_title
header_text
footnote_title
footnote_text
```


### Introduced two new classes: LocalPod and Sandbox.

The Sandbox represents the entire contents of the `POD_ROOT` (normally
`SOURCE_ROOT/Pods`). A LocalPod represents a pod that has been installed within
the Sandbox.

These two classes can be used as better homes for various pieces of logic
currently spread throughout the installation process and provide a better API
for working with the contents of this directory.


### Xcodeproj API

All Xcodeproj APIs are now in `snake_case`, instead of `camelCase`. If you are
manipulating the project from your Podfile's `post_install` hook, or from a
podspec, then update these method calls.


### Enhancements

* [#188](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/pull/188): `list` command now
  displays the specifications introduced in the master repo if it is given as an
  option the number of days to take into account.

* [#188](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/pull/188): Transferred search
  layout improvements and options to `list` command.

* [#166](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/166): Added printing
  of homepage and source to search results.

* [#177](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/177): Added `--stat`
  option to display watchers and forks for pods hosted on GitHub.

* [#177](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/177): Introduced colors
  and tuned layout of search.

* [#112](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/112): Introduced `--push`
  option to `$ pod setup`. It configures the master spec repository to use the private
  push URL. The change is preserved in future calls to `$ pod setup`.

* [#153](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/153): It is no longer
  required to call `$ pod setup`.

* [#163](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/163): Print a template
  for a new ticket when an error occurs.

* Added a new Github-specific downloader that can download repositories as a
  gzipped tarball.

* No more global state is kept during resolving of dependencies.

* Updated Xcodeproj to have a friendlier API.


### Fixes

* [#142](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/142): Xcode 4.3.2 no longer
  supports passing the -fobj-arc flag to the linker and will fail to build. The
  addition of this flag was a workaround for a compiler bug in previous versions.
  This flag is no longer included by default - to keep using this flag, you need to
  add `set_arc_compatibility_flag!` to your Podfile.

* [#183](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/183): Fix for
  `.DS_Store` file in `~/.cocoapods` prevents `$ pod install` from running.

* [#134](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/134): Match
  `IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` build setting with `deployment_target` option in
  generated Pods project file.

* [#142](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/): Add `-fobjc-arc` to
  `OTHER_LD_FLAGS` if _any_ pods require ARC.

* [#148](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/148): External encoding
  set to UTF-8 on Ruby 1.9 to fix crash caused by non-ascii characters in pod
  description.

* Ensure all header search paths are quoted in the xcconfig file.

* Added weak quoting to `ibtool` input paths.


## 0.5.0

No longer requires MacRuby. Runs on MRI 1.8.7 (OS X system version) and 1.9.3.

A full list of all the changes since 0.3.0 can be found [here][7].


## 0.4.0

Oops, accidentally skipped this version.


## 0.3.0

### Multiple targets

Add support for multiple static library targets in the Pods Xcode project with
different sets of depedencies. This means that you can create a separate
library which contains all dependencies, including extra ones that you only use
in, for instance, a debug or test build. [[docs][1]]

```ruby
# This Podfile will build three static libraries:
# * libPods.a
# * libPods-debug.a
# * libPods-test.a

# This dependency is included in the `default` target, which generates the
# `libPods.a` library, and all non-exclusive targets.
dependency 'SSCatalog'

target :debug do
  # This dependency is only included in the `debug` target, which generates
  # the `libPods-debug.a` library.
  dependency 'CocoaLumberjack'
end

target :test, :exclusive => true do
  # This dependency is *only* included in the `test` target, which generates
  # the `libPods-test.a` library.
  dependency 'Kiwi'
end
```

### Install libraries from anywhere

A dependency can take a git url if the repo contains a podspec file in its
root, or a podspec can be loaded from a file or HTTP location. If no podspec is
available, a specification can be defined inline in the Podfile. [[docs][2]]

```ruby
# From a spec repo.
dependency 'SSToolkit'

# Directly from the Pod’s repo (if it contains a podspec).
dependency 'SSToolkit', :git => 'https://github.com/samsoffes/sstoolkit.git'

# Directly from the Pod’s repo (if it contains a podspec) with a specific commit (or tag).
dependency 'SSToolkit', :git    => 'https://github.com/samsoffes/sstoolkit.git',
                        :commit => '2adcd0f81740d6b0cd4589af98790eee3bd1ae7b'

# From a podspec that's outside a spec repo _and_ the library’s repo. This can be a file or http url.
dependency 'SSToolkit', :podspec => 'https://raw.github.com/gist/1353347/ef1800da9c5f5d267a642b8d3950b41174f2a6d7/SSToolkit-0.1.1.podspec'

# If no podspec is available anywhere, you can define one right in your Podfile.
dependency do |s|
  s.name         = 'SSToolkit'
  s.version      = '0.1.3'
  s.platform     = :ios
  s.source       = { :git => 'https://github.com/samsoffes/sstoolkit.git', :commit => '2adcd0f81740d6b0cd4589af98790eee3bd1ae7b' }
  s.resources    = 'Resources'
  s.source_files = 'SSToolkit/**/*.{h,m}'
  s.frameworks   = 'QuartzCore', 'CoreGraphics'

  def s.post_install(target)
    prefix_header = config.project_pods_root + target.prefix_header_filename
    prefix_header.open('a') do |file|
      file.puts(%{#ifdef __OBJC__\n#import "SSToolkitDefines.h"\n#endif})
    end
  end
end
```

### Add a `post_install` hook to the Podfile class

This allows the user to customize, for instance, the generated Xcode project
_before_ it’s written to disk. [[docs][3]]

```ruby
# Enable garbage collection support for MacRuby applications.
post_install do |installer|
  installer.project.targets.each do |target|
    target.build_configurations.each do |config|
      config.build_settings['GCC_ENABLE_OBJC_GC'] = 'supported'
    end
  end
end
```

### Manifest

Generate a Podfile.lock file next to the Podfile, which contains a manifest of
your application’s dependencies and their dependencies.

```
PODS:
  - JSONKit (1.4)
  - LibComponentLogging-Core (1.1.4)
  - LibComponentLogging-NSLog (1.0.2):
    - LibComponentLogging-Core (>= 1.1.4)
  - RestKit-JSON-JSONKit (0.9.3):
    - JSONKit
    - RestKit (= 0.9.3)
  - RestKit-Network (0.9.3):
    - LibComponentLogging-NSLog
    - RestKit (= 0.9.3)
  - RestKit-ObjectMapping (0.9.3):
    - RestKit (= 0.9.3)
    - RestKit-Network (= 0.9.3)

DOWNLOAD_ONLY:
  - RestKit (0.9.3)

DEPENDENCIES:
  - RestKit-JSON-JSONKit
  - RestKit-ObjectMapping
```

### Generate Xcode projects from scratch

We no longer ship template projects with the gem, but instead generate them
programmatically. This code has moved out into its own [Xcodeproj gem][4],
allowing you to automate Xcode related tasks.
