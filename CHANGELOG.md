## 1.0.0.beta.6 (2016-03-15)

##### Breaking

* Running `pod install` doesn't imply an automatic spec repo update.  
  The old behavior can be achieved by passing in the option `--repo-update`
  or running `pod repo update`.  
  [Marius Rackwitz](https://github.com/mrackwitz)
  [#5004](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/5004)

  varies now between `pod install` and `pod (update|outdated)`.  
  [Marius Rackwitz](https://github.com/mrackwitz)
  [#5017](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/5017)

##### Enhancements

##### Breaking

* Development pods will no longer be implicitly unlocked. This makes CocoaPods respect
  constraints related to dependencies of development pods in the lockfile.

  If you change the constraints of a dependency of your development pod and want to
  override the locked version, you will have to use
  `pod update ${DEPENDENCY_NAME}` manually.

## 1.0.0.beta.4 (2016-02-24)

##### Enhancements

* Allow deduplication to take effect even when the same pod is used with
  different sets of subspecs across different platforms.
  This changes the general naming scheme scoped pod targets. They are
  suffixed now on base of what makes them different among others for the
  same root spec instead of being prefixed by the dependent target.  
  [Marius Rackwitz](https://github.com/mrackwitz)
  [#4146](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/pull/4146)

  [#3813](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/3813)


## 0.38.0.beta.2 (2015-07-05)

##### Enhancements

* The resolver will now take supported platform deployment targets into account
  when resolving dependencies.  
  [Samuel Giddins](https://github.com/segiddins)
  [#2443](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/2443)

* `Pods.xcodeproj` will now be written with deterministic UUIDs, vastly reducing
  project churn and merge conflicts.  This behavior can be disabled via the new
  `COCOAPODS_DISABLE_DETERMINISTIC_UUIDS` environment variable.  
  [Samuel Giddins](https://github.com/segiddins)

* [`cocoapods-stats`](https://github.com/CocoaPods/cocoapods-stats)
  is now a default plugin.  
  [Samuel Giddins](https://github.com/segiddins)

##### Bug Fixes

* Ensure that the `prepare_command` is run even when skipping the download
  cache.  
  [Samuel Giddins](https://github.com/segiddins)
  [#3674](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/3674)

* Public headers inside a directory named `framework` should be linked in the
  sandbox.  
  [Vincent Isambart](https://github.com/vincentisambart)
  [#3751](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/3751)

  [#3763](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/3763)


## 0.38.0.beta.1 (2015-06-26)

##### Highlighted Enhancement That Needs Testing

* De-duplicate Pod Targets: CocoaPods now recognizes when a dependency is used
  multiple times across different user targets, but needs to be built only once.
  The targets in `Pods.xcodeproj` need to be duplicated when one of the following
  applies:
  * They are used on different platforms.
  * They are used with differents sets of subspecs.
  * They have any dependency which needs to be duplicated.

  You can opt-out of this behavior installation-wise, by setting the following
  option in your `~/.cocoapods/config.yaml`:
  ```yaml
  deduplicate_targets: false
  ```

  [Marius Rackwitz](https://github.com/mrackwitz)
  [#3550](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/3550)

##### Breaking

* The CocoaPods environment header has been removed.  
  [Samuel Giddins](https://github.com/segiddins)
  [#2390](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/2390)

* The `Installer` is passed directly to the `pre_install` and `post_install`
  hooks defined in the Podfile, instead of the previously used
  `Hooks::InstallerRepresentation`.  
  [Marius Rackwitz](https://github.com/mrackwitz)
  [#3648](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/3648)

* Deprecate the `xcconfig` attribute in the Podspec DSL, which is replaced by
  the new attributes `pod_target_xcconfig` and `user_target_xcconfig`.  
  [Marius Rackwitz](https://github.com/mrackwitz)
  [CocoaPods#3465](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/3465)

##### Enhancements

  recommendation of using the latest stable version.  
  [Hugo Tunius](https://github.com/k0nserv)
  [#3667](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/pull/3667)

* New commands `pod cache list` and `pod cache clean` allows you to see the
  contents of the cache and clean it.  
  [Olivier Halligon](https://github.com/AliSoftware)
  [#3508](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/3508)

* The download cache will automatically be reset when changing CocoaPods
  versions.  
  [Samuel Giddins](https://github.com/segiddins)
  [#3542](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/3542)

* Supports running pre-install hooks in plugins. This happens before the resolver
  does its work, and offers easy access to the sandbox, podfile and lockfile via a
  `PreInstallHooksContext` object. This also renames the post-install hooks from `HooksContext`
  to `PostInstallHooksContext`.  
  [Orta Therox](https://github.com/orta)
  [#3540](https://github.com/CocoaPods/cocoapods/issues/3409)

* Allow passing additional arguments to `pod lib create`, which then get passed
  as-is to the `configure` scripts.  
  [Samuel Giddins](https://github.com/segiddins)
  [#2160](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/2160)

* Use `-analyzer-disable-all-checks` to disable static analyzer for

  [Vincent Isambart](https://github.com/vincentisambart)
  [#3699](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/pull/3699)

* CocoaPods will validate your podfile and try to identify problems
  and conflicts in how you've specified the dependencies.  
  [Hugo Tunius](https://github.com/k0nserv)
  [#995](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/995)

* `pod update` will now accept root pod names, even when only subspecs are
  installed.

  [#3681](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/pull/3681)

##### Bug Fixes

* Added recursive support to the public headers of vendored frameworks
  that are automatically linked in the sandbox. This fixes and issue
  for framework header directories that contain sub-directories.  
  [Todd Casey](https://github.com/vhariable)
  [#3161](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/3161)

* Public headers of vendored frameworks are now automatically linked in
  the sandbox. That allows transitive inclusion of headers from other pods.  
  [Vincent Isambart](https://github.com/vincentisambart)
  [#3161](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/3161)

* Fixes an issue that prevented static libraries from building. `OTHER_LIBTOOLFLAGS`
  is no longer set to the value of `OTHER_LDFLAGS`. If you want to create a static
  library that includes all dependencies for (internal/external) distribution then
  you should use a tool like `cocoapods-packager`.  
  [Michael Moscardini](https://github.com/themackworth)
  [#2747](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/2747)
  [#2704](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/2704)

* The embed frameworks script will now properly filter out symlinks to the
  directories that are filtered, which fixes an issue when submitting to the
  Mac App Store.  
  [Samuel Giddins](https://github.com/segiddins)

* The error report template is now more robust against missing executables.  
  [Samuel Giddins](https://github.com/segiddins)
  [#3719](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/3719)

* Attempting to specify a `git` source where a Podspec for the requested pod is
  not found will have a more helpful error message.  
  [Samuel Giddins](https://github.com/segiddins)

* `pod outdated` will now accept the `--no-repo-update` and `--no-integrate`
  options.  
  [Samuel Giddins](https://github.com/segiddins)

* Fixes an issue which prevented using a custom `CONFIGURATION_BUILD_DIR` when
  integrating CocoaPods via dynamic frameworks.  
  [Tim Rosenblatt](https://github.com/timrosenblatt)
  [#3675](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/pull/3675)

  [Mason Glidden](https://github.com/mglidden)
  [#3501](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/3501)

* Always copy the generated `Podfile.lock` to `Pods/Manifest.lock` so they are
  guaranteed to match, character-by-character, after installation.  
  [Samuel Giddins](https://github.com/segiddins)
  [#3502](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/3502)

* Don't generate an umbrella header when a custom module map is specified. This
  avoids an incomplete module map warning.

> _(✻) Note: these fixes are only temporary to avoid overriding the user project's `xcassets`.
  We are aware that these workarounds are "too greedy" and thus user projects having different
  `xcassets` for different targets will still have issues; we ([@AliSoftware](https://github.com/AliSoftware))
  are working on a deeper fix ([#3263](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/3263)) for the next release._

* Ensure that linting fails if xcodebuild doesn't successfully build your Pod.  
  [Kyle Fuller](https://github.com/kylef)
  [#2981](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/2981)
  [cocoapods-trunk#33](https://github.com/CocoaPods/cocoapods-trunk/issues/33)

* Clone the master spec repository when no spec repositories are explicitly
  defined in the Podfile. This fixes problems using CocoaPods for the first
  time without any explicit spec repositories.  
  [Kyle Fuller](https://github.com/kylef)
  [#2946](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/2946)

* Xcodebuild warnings with the string `error` in them will no longer be

• [cocoapods-plugins](https://github.com/CocoaPods/cocoapods-plugins/compare/0.3.2...0.4.0)

##### Highlighted Enhancement That Needs Testing

* Support Frameworks & Swift: CocoaPods now recognizes Swift source files and
  builds dynamic frameworks when necessary. A project can explicitly
  opt-in via `use_frameworks!` in the Podfile, or if any dependency contains
  Swift code, all pods for that target will be integrated as frameworks.

  As a pod author, you can change the module name of the built framework by
  specifying a `module_name` in the podspec. The built frameworks are embedded into
  the host application with a new shell script build phase in the user's
  project allowing configuration-dependent pods.

  [Marius Rackwitz](https://github.com/mrackwitz)
  [#2835](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/2835)

##### Breaking

* Bundle Resources into Frameworks: Previously all resources were compiled and
  copied into the `mainBundle`. Now Pods have to use
  `[NSBundle bundleForClass:<#Class from Pod#>]` to access provided resources
  relative to the bundle.

  [Boris Bügling](https://github.com/neonichu)
  [#2835](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/2730)

* Only the hooks specified by usage of the `plugin` directive of the `Podfile`
  will be run. Additionally, plugins that depend on hooks will have to update to
  specify their 'plugin name' when registering the hooks in order to make it
  possible for those hooks to be run.  
  [Samuel Giddins](https://github.com/segiddins)
  [#2640](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/2640)

##### Enhancements

* Do not generate targets for Pods without sources.  
  [Boris Bügling](https://github.com/neonichu)
  [#2918](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/2918)

* Show the name of the source for each hook that is run in verbose mode.  
  [Samuel Giddins](https://github.com/segiddins)
  [#2639](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/2639)

* Move pods' private headers to `Headers/Private` from `Headers/Build`.
  Since some SCM ignore templates include `build` by default, this makes it
  easier to check in the `Pods/` directory.  
  [Samuel Giddins](https://github.com/segiddins)
  [#2623](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/2623)

* Validate that a specification's `public_header_files` and
  `private_header_files` file patterns only match header files.
  Also, validate that all file patterns, if given, match at least one file.  
  [Samuel Giddins](https://github.com/segiddins)
  [#2914](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/2914)

* Installer changed to organize a development pod's source and resource files

  spec.  
  [Samuel Giddins](https://github.com/segiddins)
  [#1919](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/1919)

* Fix the reading of podspecs that come from the `:git`, `:svn`, `:http`, or
  `:hg` options in your `Podfile` that used context-dependent ruby code, such as
  reading a file to determine the specification version.  
  [Samuel Giddins](https://github.com/segiddins)

For more details, see 📝 [CocoaPods 0.35](https://blog.cocoapods.org/CocoaPods-0.35/) on our blog.

##### Enhancements

* Allow the specification of file patterns for the Podspec's `requires_arc`
  attribute.  
  [Kyle Fuller](https://github.com/kylef)
  [Samuel Giddins](https://github.com/segiddins)
  [#532](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/532)

* From now on, pods installed directly from their repositories will be recorded
  in the `Podfile.lock` file and will be guaranteed to be checked-out using the
  same revision on subsequent installations. Examples of this are when using
  the `:git`, `:svn`, or `:hg` options in your `Podfile`.  
  [Samuel Giddins](https://github.com/segiddins)
  [#1058](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/1058)

  and `pod trunk`.
  [Olivier Halligon](https://github.com/AliSoftware)
  [#2603](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/2603)

* Show a helpful error message if the old resolver incorrectly activated a
  pre-release version that now leads to a version conflict.  
  [Samuel Giddins](https://github.com/segiddins)

* Provides a user friendly message when using `pod spec create` with a
  repository that doesn't yet have any commits.  
  [Kyle Fuller](https://github.com/kylef)
  [#2803](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/2803)

  build configuration name.  
  [Kyle Fuller](https://github.com/kylef)
  [#2767](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/2767)

* Pods will use `CLANG_ENABLE_OBJC_ARC = 'YES'` instead of
  `CLANG_ENABLE_OBJC_ARC = 'NO'`. For pods with `requires_arc = false` the
  `-fno-objc-arc` flag will be specified for the all source files.  
  [Hugo Tunius](https://github.com/K0nserv)
  [#2262](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/2262)

* Fixed an issue that Core Data mapping models where not compiled when
  copying resources to main application bundle.  
  [Yan Rabovik](https://github.com/rabovik)

* Fix uninitialized constant Class::YAML crash in some cases.
  [Tim Shadel](https://github.com/timshadel)

##### Enhancements

* `pod search`, `pod spec which`, `pod spec cat` and `pod spec edit`
  now use plain text search by default instead of a regex. Especially
  `pod search UIView+UI` now searches for pods containing exactly `UIView+UI`
  in their name, not trying to interpret the `+` as a regular expression.
  _Note: You can still use a regular expression with the new `--regex` flag that has
  been added to these commands, e.g. `pod search --regex "(NS|UI)Color"`._
  [Olivier Halligon](https://github.com/AliSoftware)
  [Core#188](https://github.com/CocoaPods/Core/issues/188)

* Use `--allow-warnings` rather than `--error-only` for pod spec validation

## 0.35.0.rc2 (2014-11-06)

##### Enhancements

* Allow the resolver to fail faster when there are unresolvable conflicts
  involving the Lockfile.  
  [Samuel Giddins](https://github.com/segiddins)

##### Bug Fixes

  [#2759](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/2759)

## 0.35.0.rc1 (2014-11-02)

##### Highlighted Enhancements That Need Testing

* The `Resolver` has been completely rewritten to use
  [Molinillo](https://github.com/CocoaPods/Molinillo), an iterative dependency
  resolution algorithm that automatically resolves version conflicts.
  The order in which dependencies are declared in the `Podfile` no longer has
  any effect on the resolution process.

  You should ensure that `pod install`, `pod update` and `pod update [NAME]`
  work as expected and install the correct versions of your pods during
  this RC1 release.
  [Samuel Giddins](https://github.com/segiddins)
  [#978](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/978)
  [#2002](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/2002)

##### Breaking

* Support for older versions of Ruby has been dropped and CocoaPods now depends
  on Ruby 2.0.0 or greater. This is due to the release of Xcode 6.0 which has
  dropped support for OS X 10.8, which results in the minimum version of
  Ruby pre-installed on OS X now being 2.0.0.

  If you are using a custom installation of Ruby  older than 2.0.0, you
  will need to update. Or even better, migrate to system Ruby.  
  [Kyle Fuller](https://github.com/kylef)

* Attempts to resolve circular dependencies will now raise an exception.  
  [Samuel Giddins](https://github.com/segiddins)
  [Molinillo#6](https://github.com/CocoaPods/Molinillo/issues/6)

##### Enhancements

* The use of implicit sources has been un-deprecated. By default, all available
  spec-repos will be used. There should only be a need to specify explicit
  sources if you want to specifically _exclude_ certain spec-repos, such as the
  `master` spec-repo, if you want to declare the order of spec look-up
  precedence, or if you want other users of a Podfile to automatically have a
  spec-repo cloned on `pod install`.  
  [Eloy Durán](https://github.com/alloy)

* The `pod push` command has been removed as it has been deprecated in favour of
  `pod repo push` in CocoaPods 0.33.  
  [Fabio Pelosin](https://github.com/fabiopelosin)

* Refactorings in preparation to framework support, which could break usage
  of the Hooks API.  
  [Marius Rackwitz](https://github.com/mrackwitz)
  [#2461](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/2461)

* Implicit dependencies are now locked, so simply running `pod install` will not
  cause them to be updated when they shouldn't be.  
  [Samuel Giddins](https://github.com/segiddins)
  [#2318](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/2318)
  [#2506](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/2506)

* Pre-release versions are only considered in the resolution process when there
  are dependencies that explicitly reference pre-release requirements.  
  [Samuel Giddins](https://github.com/segiddins)
  [#1489](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/1489)

* Only setup the master specs repo if required.  
  [Daniel Tomlinson](https://github.com/DanielTomlinson)
  [#2562](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/2562)

* `Sandbox::FileAccessor` now optionally includes expanded paths of headers of
  vendored frameworks in `public_headers`.  
  [Eloy Durán](https://github.com/alloy)
  [#2722](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/pull/2722)

* Analysis is now halted and the user informed when there are multiple different
  external sources for dependencies with the same root name.
  The user is also now warned when there are duplicate dependencies in the
  Podfile.  
  [Samuel Giddins](https://github.com/segiddins)
  [#2738](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/2738)

* Multiple subspecs that point to the same external dependency will now only
  cause that external source to be fetched once.  
  [Samuel Giddins](https://github.com/segiddins)
  [#2743](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/2743)

##### Bug Fixes

* Fixes an issue in the `XCConfigIntegrator` where not all targets that need
  integration were being integrated, but were getting incorrect warnings about
  the user having specified a custom base configuration.  
  [Eloy Durán](https://github.com/alloy)
  [2752](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/2752)

* Do not try to clone spec-repos in `/`.  
  [Eloy Durán](https://github.com/alloy)
  [#2723](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/2723)

* Improved sanitizing of configuration names which have a numeric prefix.  
  [Steffen Matthischke](https://github.com/HeEAaD)
  [#2700](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/pull/2700)

* Fixes an issues where headers from a podspec with one platform are exposed to
  targets with a different platform. The headers are now only exposed to the
  targets with the same platform.

  [#2532](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/pull/2532)


## 0.34.1 (2014-09-26)

##### Bug Fixes

* Doesn't take into account the trailing `.git` in repository URLs when
  trying to find a matching specs repo.  
  [Samuel Giddins](https://github.com/segiddins)
  [#2526](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/2526)


## 0.34.0 (2014-09-26)

For more details, see 📝 [CocoaPods 0.34](https://blog.cocoapods.org/CocoaPods-0.34/) on our blog.

##### Breaking

* Add support for loading podspecs from *only* specific spec-repos via
  `sources`. By default, when there are no sources specified in a Podfile all
  source repos will be used. This has always been the case. However, this
  implicit use of sources is now deprecated. Once you specify specific sources,
  **no** repos will be included by default. For example:

        source 'https://github.com/artsy/Specs.git'
        source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'

  Any source URLs specified that have not yet been added will be cloned before
  resolution begins.

  [#1455](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/1455)

##### Bug Fixes

* Works around an Xcode issue where linting would fail even though `xcodebuild`
  actually succeeds. Xcode.app also doesn't fail when this issue occurs, so it's
  safe for us to do the same.

  [#2473](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/2473)


## 0.34.0.rc1 (2014-09-13)

##### Breaking

* The use of the `$PODS_ROOT` environment variable has been deprecated and
  should not be used. It will be removed in future versions of CocoaPods.  
  [#2449](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/2449)

* Add support for loading podspecs from specific spec-repos _only_, a.k.a. ‘sources’.
  By default, when not specifying any specific sources in your Podfile, the ‘master’
  spec-repo will be used, as was always the case. However, once you specify specific
  sources the ‘master’ spec-repo will **not** be included by default. For example:

        source 'private-spec-repo'
        source 'master'

  [Core#19](https://github.com/CocoaPods/Core/pull/19)

* The `Pods` directory has been reorganized. This might require manual
  intervention in projects where files generated by CocoaPods have manually been
  imported into the user's project (common with the acknowledgements files).

  `./lib`.  
  [Fabio Pelosin](https://github.com/fabiopelosin)
  [CLAide#28](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CLAide/pull/28)

  [Fabio Pelosin](https://github.com/fabiopelosin)
  [CocoaPods#267](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/267)

##### Enhancements

* Add support to specify dependencies per build configuration:

        pod 'Lookback', :configurations => ['Debug']

  Currently configurations can only be specified per single Pod.

  [Xcodeproj#168](https://github.com/CocoaPods/Xcodeproj/pull/168)
  [Xcodeproj#167](https://github.com/CocoaPods/Xcodeproj/issues/167)

* Add hooks for plugins. Currently only the installer hook is supported.
  A plugin can register itself to be activated after the installation with the
  following syntax:

      Pod::HooksManager.register(:post_install) do |installer_context|
        # implementation
      end

  The `installer_context` is an instance of the `Pod::Installer:HooksContext`
  class which provides the information about the installation.  
  [Fabio Pelosin](https://github.com/fabiopelosin)

###### Enhancements

* Radically reduce first run pod setup bandwidth by creating a shallow clone of
  the ‘master’ repo by default. Use the `--no-shallow` option to perform a full
  clone instead.  
  [Jeff Verkoeyen](https://github.com/jverkoey)
  [#1803](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/pull/1803)

* Improves the error message when searching with an invalid regular expression.  
  [Kyle Fuller](https://github.com/kylef)

* Improves `pod init` to save Xcode project file in Podfile when one was supplied.  
  [Kyle Fuller](https://github.com/kylef)

* Adds functionality to specify a template URL for the `pod lib create` command.

###### Breaking

* The command `podfile_info` is now a plugin offered by CocoaPods.
  As a result, the command has been removed from CocoaPods.  
  [Joshua Kalpin](https://github.com/Kapin)
  [#1589](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/1589)

* JSON has been adopted as the format to store specifications. As a result
  the `pod ipc spec` command returns a JSON representation and the YAML
  specifications are not supported anymore. JSON specifications adopt the
  `.podspec.json` extension.
  [Fabio Pelosin](https://github.com/fabiopelosin)
  [#1568](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/pull/1568)

###### Enhancements

* Introduced `pod try` the easiest way to test the example project of a pod.  
  [Fabio Pelosin](https://github.com/fabiopelosin)
  [#1568](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/pull/1568)

* Pod headers are now provided to the user target as a system
  header. This means that any warnings in a Pod's code will show
  under its target in Xcode's build navigator, and never under the
  user target.  
  [Swizzlr](https://github.com/swizzlr)
  [#1596](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/pull/1596)

* Support LZMA2 compressed tarballs in the downloader.

  [Florian Hanke](https://github.com/floere)
  [#1643](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/pull/1643)

* Pod lib lint now accepts multiple podspecs in the same folder.  
  [kra Larivain/OpenTable](https://github.com/opentable)
  [#1635](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/pull/1635)

* The `pod push` command will now silently test the upcoming CocoaPods trunk
  service. The service is only tested when pushing to the master repo and the
  test doesn't affect the normal workflow.  
  [Fabio Pelosin](https://github.com/fabiopelosin)

* The `pod search <query>` command now supports searching on cocoapods.org
  when searching using the option `--web`. Options `--ios` and `--osx` are
  fully supported.
  [Florian Hanke](https://github.com/floere)
  [#1643](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/pull/1682)

  headers.  
  [Fabio Pelosin](https://github.com/fabiopelosin)
  [#1566](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/1566)

* Fixed the developer frameworks search paths so that
  `$(SDKROOT)/Developer/Library/Frameworks` is used for iOS and
  `$(DEVELOPER_LIBRARY_DIR)/Frameworks` is used for OS X.  
  [Kevin Wales](https://github.com/kwales)
  [#1562](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/pull/1562)

* When updating the pod repos, repositories with unreachable remotes
  are now ignored. This fixes an issue with certain private repositories.

  [Core#39](https://github.com/CocoaPods/Core/pull/39)
  [#1610](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/1610)

* Having the silent flag enabled in the config will no longer cause issues
  with `pod search`. In addition, the flag `--silent` is no longer supported
  for the command.  
  [Joshua Kalpin](https://github.com/Kapin)
  [#1627](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/pull/1627)

* The linter will now display an error if a framework ends with `.framework`
  (i.e. `QuartzCore.framework`).  
  [Joshua Kalpin](https://github.com/Kapin)
  [#1331](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/1336)
  [Core#45](https://github.com/CocoaPods/Core/pull/45)

* The linter will now display an error if a library ends with `.a` or `.dylib`
  (i.e. `z.dylib`). It will also display an error if it begins with `lib`
  (i.e. `libxml`).  
  [Joshua Kalpin](https://github.com/Kapin)
  [Core#44](https://github.com/CocoaPods/Core/issues/44)

* The ARCHS build setting can come back as an array when more than one
  architecture is specified.  
  [Carson McDonald](https://github.com/carsonmcdonald)
  [#1628](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/1628)

* Fixed all issues caused by `/tmp` being a symlink to `/private/tmp`.
  This affected mostly `pod lib lint`, causing it to fail when the
  Pod used `prefix_header_*` or when the pod headers imported headers
  using the namespaced syntax (e.g. `#import <MyPod/Header.h>`).  
  [kra Larivain/OpenTable](https://github.com/opentable)
  [#1514](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/pull/1514)

For more details, see 📝 [CocoaPods 0.28](https://blog.cocoapods.org/CocoaPods-0.28/) on our blog.

###### Enhancements

* CLAide now supports gem plugins. An example CocoaPods plugin can be found at
  [open\_pod\_bay](https://github.com/leshill/open_pod_bay).

  As of yet there are no promises made yet on the APIs, so try to fail as
  gracefully as possible in case a CocoaPods update breaks your usage. In these

###### Bug Fixes

* Compiling `xcassets` with `actool` now uses `UNLOCALIZED_RESOURCES_FOLDER_PATH`
  instead of `PRODUCT_NAME.WRAPPER_EXTENSION` as output directory as it is more
  accurate and allows the project to overwrite `WRAPPER_NAME`.  
  [Marc Knaup](https://github.com/fluidsonic)
  [#1556](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/pull/1556)

* Added a condition to avoid compiling xcassets when `WRAPPER_EXTENSION`
  is undefined, as it would be in the case of static libraries. This prevents
  trying to copy the compiled files to a directory that does not exist.  
  [Noah McCann](https://github.com/nmccann)
  [#1521](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/pull/1521)

* Added additional condition to check if `actool` is available when compiling
  `xcassets`. This prevents build failures of Xcode 5 projects on Travis CI (or
  lower Xcode versions).  
  [Michal Konturek](https://github.com/michalkonturek)
  [#1511](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/pull/1511)

* Added a condition to properly handle universal or mac apps when compiling
  xcassets. This prevents build errors in the xcassets compilation stage
  particularly when using xctool to build.  
  [Ryan Marsh](https://github.com/ryanwmarsh)

  name closely matching the name of one of the subspec's parents.  
  [Noah McCann](https://github.com/nmccann)
  [#29](https://github.com/CocoaPods/Core/pull/29)

* The developer dir relative to the SDK is not added anymore if testing
  frameworks are detected in OS X targets, as it doesn't exists, avoiding the

For more details, see 📝 [CocoaPods 0.26](https://blog.cocoapods.org/CocoaPods-0.26/) on our blog.

###### Enhancements

* CocoaPods now creates and hides the schemes of its targets after every
  installation. The schemes are not shared because the flag which keeps track
  whether they should be visible is a user only flag. The schemes are still
  present and to debug a single Pod it is possible to make its scheme visible
  in the Schemes manager of Xcode. This is rarely needed though because the
  user targets trigger the compilation of the Pod targets.  
  [Fabio Pelosin](https://github.com/fabiopelosin)
  [#1185](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/pull/1185)

* Installations which don't integrate a user target (lint subcommands and
  `--no-integrate` option) now set the architecture of OS X Pod targets to
  `$(ARCHS_STANDARD_64_BIT)` (Xcode 4 default value for new targets). This
  fixes lint issues with Xcode 4.  
  [Fabio Pelosin](https://github.com/fabiopelosin)
  [#1185](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/pull/1185)

* Further improvements to the organization of the Pods project  

  - The project is now is sorted by name with groups at the bottom.
  - Source files are now stored in the root group of the spec, subspecs are not
    stored in a `Subspec` group anymore and the products of the Pods all are
    stored in the products group of the project.
  - The frameworks are referenced relative to the Developer directory and
    namespaced per platform.

  specified relatively.  
  [Fabio Pelosin](https://github.com/fabiopelosin)
  [#1405](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/pull/1405)

* Fix an issue where CocoaPods would fail to work when used with an older
  version of the Active Support gem. This fix raises the dependency version to
  the earliest compatible version of Active Support.  
  [Kyle Fuller](https://github.com/kylef)
  [#1407](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/1407)

• [Xcodeproj](https://github.com/CocoaPods/Xcodeproj/compare/0.10.1...0.11.0)

###### Enhancements

* Added support for Xcode 5.

  The generated Pods Xcode project is now compatible with `arm64` projects and
  is updated to use Xcode 5’s default settings removing all warnings.

  **NOTE to users migrating projects from Xcode 4, or are still using Xcode 4:**
  1. The Pods Xcode project now sets the `ONLY_ACTIVE_ARCH` build setting to
     `YES` in the `Debug` configuration. You _will_ have to set the same on your
     project/target, otherwise the build _will_ fail.
  2. Ensure your project/target has an `ARCHS` value set, otherwise the build
     _will_ fail.
  3. When building a **iOS** project from the command-line, with the `xcodebuild`
     tool that comes with Xcode 4, you’ll need to completely disable this setting
     by appending to your build command: `ONLY_ACTIVE_ARCH=NO`.

  [#1352](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/pull/1352)

* Speed up project generation in `pod install` and `pod update`.

* The pre and post install hooks that have been deprecated now include the name
  and version of the spec that’s using them.

###### Bug Fixes

* Only create a single resource bundle for all targets. Prior to this change a
  resource bundle included into multiple targets within the project would create
  duplicately named targets in the Pods Xcode project, causing duplicately named
  Schemes to be created on each invocation of `pod install`. All targets that
  reference a given resource bundle now have dependencies on a single common
  target.

  [Blake Watters](https://github.com/blakewatters)
  [#1338](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/1338)

* Solved outstanding issues with CocoaPods resource bundles and Archive builds:
  1. The rsync task copies symlinks into the App Bundle, producing an invalid
     app. This change add `--copy-links` to the rsync invocation to ensure the
     target files are copied rather than the symlink.
  2. The Copy Resources script uses `TARGET_BUILD_DIR` which points to the App
     Archiving folder during an Archive action. Switching to
     `BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR` instead ensures that the path is correct for all
     actions and configurations.

• [cocoapods-downloader](https://github.com/CocoaPods/cocoapods-downloader/compare/0.1.1...0.2.0)

###### Enhancements

* Added `pod init` command which generates a Podfile according to the
  targets of the project stored in the working directory and to the templates
  stored in the `~/.cocoapods/templates` folder. Two templates are supported:
    - the `Podfile.default` template for regular targets.
    - and the `Podfile.test` template for test targets.

  [#1106](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/1106)
  [#1045](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/1045)

* CocoaPods will now leverage the [xcproj](https://github.com/0xced/xcproj)
  command line tool if available in the path of the user to touch saved
  projects. This will result in projects being serialized in the exact format
  used by Xcode eliminating merge conflicts and other related issues. To learn
  more about how to install xcproj see its
  [readme](https://github.com/0xced/xcproj).
  [Cédric Luthi](https://github.com/0xced)
  [#1275](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/1275)

* Rationalized and cleaned up Pods project group structure and path specification.

* Create all necessary build configurations for *Pods.xcodeproj* at the project level. If the user’s project has more than just *Debug* and *Release* build configurations, they may be explicitly specified in the Podfile:  
`xcodeproj 'MyApp', 'App Store' => :release, 'Debug' => :debug, 'Release' => :release`  
  If build configurations aren’t specified in the Podfile then they will be automatically picked from the user’s project in *Release* mode.  
  These changes will ensure that the `libPods.a` static library is not stripped for all configurations, as explained in [#1217](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/pull/1217).

###### Enhancements

* Added `prepare_command` attribute to Specification DSL. The prepare command
  will replace the `pre_install` hook. The `post_install` hook has also been
  deprecated.
  [#1247](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/1247)

  The reason we provided Ruby hooks at first, was because we wanted to offer
  the option to make any required configuration possible. By now, however, we
  have a pretty good idea of the use-cases and are therefore locking down the
  freedom that was once available. In turn, we’re adding attributes that can
  replace the most common use-cases. _(See the enhancements directly following
  this entry for more info)._

  The second reason we need to lock this down is because this is the last
  remaining obstacle to fully serialize specifications, which we need in order
  to move to a ‘spec push’ web-service in the future.

* Added `resource_bundles` attribute to the Specification DSL.  
  [#743](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/743)

###### Bug Fixes

* Always exlude `USE_HEADERMAP` from the user’s project.
  [#1216](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/1216)

* Use correct template repo when using the `pod lib create` command.
  [#1214](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/1214)

* Fixed issue with `pod push` failing when the podspec is unchanged. It will now
  report `[No change] ExamplePod (0.1.0)` and continue to push other podspecs if
  they exist. [#1199](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/pull/1199)

* Set STRIP_INSTALLED_PRODUCT = NO in the generated Pods project. This allows
  Xcode to include symbols from CocoaPods in dSYMs during Archive builds.

###### Bug fixes

* Specifications defining build setting with the `[*]` syntax are now properly
  handled.
  [#1171](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/1171)

* The name of the files references are now properly set fixing a minor
  regression introduced by CocoaPods 0.22.1 and matching more closely Xcode
  behaviour.

* The validator now builds the Pods target instead of the first target actually
  performing the validation.

* Build settings defined through the `xcconfig` attribute of a `podspec` are now
  stripped of duplicate values when merged in an aggregate target.

###### Enhancements

* Added the `pod lib create` subcommand which allows to create a new Pod
  adhering to the best practices. The template is still a bit primitive
  and we encourage users to provide feedback by submitting patches and issues
  to https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods.
  [#850](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/850)

* Added the `pod lib lint` subcommand which allows to lint the Pod stored
  in the working directory (a pod spec in the root is needed). This subcommand
  is equivalent to the deprecated `pod spec lint --local`.
  [#850](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/850)

* The dependencies of the targets of the Pods project are now made explicit.

###### Enhancements

* Introduces an experimental sandbox feature.
  [#939](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/939)

  Let’s face it, even though we have a great community that spends an amazing
  amount of time on curating the specifications, the internet can be a hostile
  place and the community is growing too large to take a naive approach any
  longer.

  As such, we have started leveraging OS X’s sandbox facilities to disallow
  unsanctioned operations. This is still very experimental and therefore has to
  be used explicitely, for now, but that does **not** mean we don’t want you to
  start using it and **report issues**.

  To use the sandbox, simply use the `sandbox-pod` command instead. E.g.:

        $ sandbox-pod install

  In case of issues, be sure to check `/var/log/system.log` for ‘deny’ messages.
  For instance, here’s an example where the sandbox denies read access to `/`:

        May 16 00:23:35 Khaos kernel[0]: Sandbox: ruby(98430) deny file-read-data /

  **NOTE**: _The above example is actually one that we know of. We’re not sure
  yet which process causes this, but there shouldn’t be a need for any process
  to read data from the root path anyways._

  **NOTE 2**: _At the moment the sandbox is not compatible with the `:path` option
  when referencing Pods that are not stored within the directory of the Podfile._

* The naked `pod` command now defaults to `pod install`.
  [#958](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/958)

* CocoaPods will look for the Podfile in the ancestors paths if one is
  not available in the working directory.
  [#940](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/940)

* Documentation generation has been removed from CocoaPods as it graduated
  to CocoaDocs. This decision was taken because CocoaDocs is a much better
  solution which doesn't clutter Xcode's docsets while still allowing
  access to the docsets with Xcode and with Dash. Removing this feature
  keeps the installer leaner and easier to develop and paves the way for the
  upcoming sandbox. Private pods can use pre install hook to generate the
  documentation. If there will be enough demand this feature might be
  reintegrated as plugin (see
  [#1037](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/1037)).

* Improved performance of the copy resources script and thus build time of
  the integrated targets. Contribution by [@onato](https://github.com/onato)
  [#1050](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/1050).

* The changelog for the current version is printed after CocoaPods is
  installed/updated.
  [#853](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/853).


###### Bug fixes

* Inheriting `inhibit_warnings` per pod is now working
  [#1032](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/1032)
* Fix copy resources script for iOS < 6 and OS X < 10.8 by removing the
  `--reference-external-strings-file`

* Compile time introspection. Macro definitions which allow to inspect the
  installed Pods and their version have been introduced in the build
  environment of the Pod libraries
  ([example](https://gist.github.com/fabiopelosin/5348551)).
* CocoaPods now defines the `COCOAPODS=1` macro in the Pod and the Client
  targets. This is useful for libraries which conditionally expose interfaces.
  [#903](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/903)
* Added support for the `private_header_files` attribute of the Specification
  DSL.
  [#998](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/998)
* CocoaPods now defines the deployment target of the Pods project computed as
  the minimum deployment target of the Pods libraries.
  [#556](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/556)
* Added `pod podfile-info` command. Shows list of used Pods and their info
  in a project or supplied Podfile.
  Options: `--all` - with dependencies. `--md` - in Markdown.
  [#855](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/855)
* Added `pod help` command. You can still use the old format
  with --help flag.
  [#957](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/pull/957)
* Restored support for Podfiles named `CocoaPods.podfile`. Moreover, the
  experimental YAML format of the Podfile now is associated with files named
  `CocoaPods.podfile.yaml`.
  [#1004](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/pull/1004)

###### Deprecations

* The `:local` flag in Podfile has been renamed to `:path` and the old syntax

###### __Notice__

At some point in future the master repo will be switched to the YAML format of
specifications. This means that specifications with hooks (or any other kind of
dynamic logic) will not be accepted. Please let us know if there is need for
other DSL attributes or any other kind of support.

Currently the following specifications fail to load as they depended on the
CocoaPods internals and need to be updated:

- LibComponentLogging-pods/0.0.1/LibComponentLogging-pods.podspec
- RestKit/0.9.3/RestKit.podspec
- Three20/1.0.11/Three20.podspec
- ARAnalytics/1.1/ARAnalytics.podspec

Other specifications, might present compatibility issues for the reasons
presented below.

###### __Breaking__

- Subspecs do **not** inherit the files patterns from the parent spec anymore.
  This feature made the implementation more complicated and was not easy to
  explain to podspecs maintainers. Compatibility can be easily fixed by adding
  a 'Core' subspec.
- Support for inline podspecs has been removed.
- The support for Rake::FileList is being deprecated, in favor of a more
  consistent DSL. Rake::FileList also presented issues because it would access
  the file system as soon as it was converted to an array.
- The hooks architecture has been re-factored and might present
  incompatibilities (please open an issue if appropriate).
- The `requires_arc` attribute default value is transitioning from `false` to
  `true`. In the meanwhile a value is needed to pass the lint.
- Deprecated `copy_header_mapping` hook.
- Deprecated `exclude_header_search_paths` attribute.
- External sources are not supported in the dependencies of specifications
  anymore. Actually they never have been supported, they just happened to work.

###### DSL

- Podfile:
  - It is not needed to specify the platform anymore (unless not integrating)
    as CocoaPods now can infer the platform from the integrated targets.
- Specification:
  - `preferred_dependency` has been renamed to `default_subspec`.
  - Added `exclude_files` attribute.
  - Added `screenshots` attribute.
  - Added default values for attributes like `source_files`.

###### Enhancements

- Released preview [documentation](http://docs.cocoapods.org).
- CocoaPods now has support for working in teams and not committing the Pods
  folder, as it will keep track of the status of the Pods folder.
  [#552](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/552)
- Simplified installation: no specific version of ruby gems is required anymore.
- The workspace is written only if needed greatly reducing the occasions in
  which Xcode asks to revert.
- The Lockfile is sorted reducing the SCM noise.
  [#591](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/591)
- Added Podfile, Frameworks, and Resources to the Pods project.
  [#647](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/647)
  [#588](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/588)
- Adds new subcommand `pod spec cat NAME` to print a spec file to standard output.
- Specification hooks are only called when the specification is installed.
- The `--no-clean` option of the `pod spec lint` command now displays the Pods
  project for inspection.
- It is now possible to specify default values for the configuration in
  `~/.cocoapods/config.yaml` ([default values](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/blob/master/lib/cocoapods/config.rb#L17)).
- CocoaPods now checks the checksums of the installed specifications and
  reinstalls them if needed.
- Support for YAML formats of the Podfile and the Specification.
- Added new command `pod ipc` to provide support for inter process
  communication through YAML formats.
- CocoaPods now detects if the folder of a Pod is empty and reinstalls it.
  [#534](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/534)
- Install hooks and the `prefix_header_contents` attribute are supported in subspecs.
  [#617](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/617)
- Dashes are now supported in the versions of the Pods.
  [#293](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/293)

###### Bug fixes

- CocoaPods is not confused anymore by target definitions with different activated subspec.
  [#535](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/535)
- CocoaPods is not confused anymore by to dependencies from external sources.
  [#548](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/548)
- The git cache will always update against the remote if a tag is requested,
  resolving issues where library maintainers where updating the tag after a
  lint and would be confused by CocoaPods using the cached commit for the tag.
  [#407](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/407)
  [#596](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/596)

###### Codebase

  - ia podspec can’t be found in the root of an external source.
    [#385](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/385),
    [#338](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/338),
    [#337](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/337).
  - a subspec name is misspelled.
    [#327](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/327)
  - an unrecognized command and/or argument is provided.
- The subversion downloader now does an export instead of a checkout, which
  makes it play nicer with SCMs that store metadata in each directory.
  [#245](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/245)
- Now the Podfile is added to the Pods project for convenient editing.

###### Bug fixes

- The git cache now fetches the tags from the remote if it can’t find the
  reference.
- Xcodeproj now builds on 10.6.8 and Travis CI without symlinking headers.
- Only try to install, add source files to the project, and clean a Pod once.
  [#376](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/376)

###### Notes

- External Pods might be reinstalled due to the migration to the new
  `Podfile.lock`.
- The SCM reference of head Pods is not preserved across machines.
- Pods whose inline specification changed are not detected as modified. As a
  workaround, remove their folder stored in `Pods`.
- Pods whose specification changed are not detected as modified. As a
  workaround, remove their folder stored in `Pods`.

A full list of all the changes since 0.5.1 can be found [here][6].


### Link with specific targets

CocoaPods can now integrate all the targets specified in your `Podfile`.

To specify which target, in your Xcode project, a Pods target should be linked
with, use the `link_with` method like so:

```ruby
platform :ios

workspace 'MyWorkspace'

link_with ['MyAppTarget', 'MyOtherAppTarget']
dependency 'JSONKit'

target :test, :exclusive => true do
  xcodeproj 'TestProject', 'Test' => :debug
  link_with 'TestRunnerTarget'
  dependency 'Kiwi'
end
```

_NOTE: As you can see it can take either one target name, or an array of names._

* If no explicit Xcode workspace is specified and only **one** project exists in
the same directory as the Podfile, then the name of that project is used as the
workspace’s name.

* If no explicit Xcode project is specified for a target, it will use the Xcode
project of the parent target. If no target specifies an expicit Xcode project
and there is only **one** project in the same directory as the Podfile then that
project will be used.

* If no explicit target is specified, then the Pods target will be linked with
the first target in your project. So if you only have one target you do not
need to specify the target to link with.

See [#76](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/76) for more info.

Finally, CocoaPods will add build configurations to the Pods project for all
configurations in the other projects in the workspace. By default the
configurations are based on the `Release` configuration, to base them on the
`Debug` configuration you will have to explicitely specify them as can be seen
above in the following line:

```ruby
xcodeproj 'TestProject', 'Test' => :debug
```


### Documentation

CocoaPods will now generate documentation for every library with the
[`appledoc`][5] tool and install it into Xcode’s documentation viewer.

You can customize the settings used like so:

```ruby
s.documentation = { :appledoc => ['--product-name', 'My awesome project!'] }
```

Alternatively, you can specify a URL where an HTML version of the documentation
can be found:

```ruby
s.documentation = { :html => 'http://example.com/docs/index.html' }
```

See [#149](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/149) and
[#151](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/151) for more info.


### Licenses & Documentation

CocoaPods will now generate two 'Acknowledgements' files for each target specified
in your Podfile which contain the License details for each Pod used in that target
(assuming details have been specified in the Pod spec).

There is a markdown file, for general consumption, as well as a property list file
that can be added to a settings bundle for an iOS application.

You don't need to do anything for this to happen, it should just work.

If you're not happy with the default boilerplate text generated for the title, header
and footnotes in the files, it's possible to customize these by overriding the methods
that generate the text in your `Podfile` like this:

```ruby
class ::Pod::Generator::Acknowledgements
  def header_text
    "My custom header text"
  end
end
```

You can even go one step further and customize the text on a per target basis by
checking against the target name, like this:

```ruby
class ::Pod::Generator::Acknowledgements
  def header_text
    if @target_definition.label.end_with?("MyTargetName")
      "Custom header text for MyTargetName"
    else
      "Custom header text for other targets"
    end
  end
end
```

Finally, here's a list of the methods that are available to override:

```ruby
header_title
header_text
footnote_title
footnote_text
```


### Introduced two new classes: LocalPod and Sandbox.

The Sandbox represents the entire contents of the `POD_ROOT` (normally
`SOURCE_ROOT/Pods`). A LocalPod represents a pod that has been installed within
the Sandbox.

These two classes can be used as better homes for various pieces of logic
currently spread throughout the installation process and provide a better API
for working with the contents of this directory.


### Xcodeproj API

All Xcodeproj APIs are now in `snake_case`, instead of `camelCase`. If you are
manipulating the project from your Podfile's `post_install` hook, or from a
podspec, then update these method calls.


### Enhancements

* [#188](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/pull/188): `list` command now
  displays the specifications introduced in the master repo if it is given as an
  option the number of days to take into account.

* [#188](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/pull/188): Transferred search
  layout improvements and options to `list` command.

* [#166](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/166): Added printing
  of homepage and source to search results.

* [#177](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/177): Added `--stat`
  option to display watchers and forks for pods hosted on GitHub.

* [#177](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/177): Introduced colors
  and tuned layout of search.

* [#112](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/112): Introduced `--push`
  option to `$ pod setup`. It configures the master spec repository to use the private
  push URL. The change is preserved in future calls to `$ pod setup`.

* [#153](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/153): It is no longer
  required to call `$ pod setup`.

* [#163](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/163): Print a template
  for a new ticket when an error occurs.

* Added a new Github-specific downloader that can download repositories as a
  gzipped tarball.

* No more global state is kept during resolving of dependencies.

* Updated Xcodeproj to have a friendlier API.


### Fixes

* [#142](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/142): Xcode 4.3.2 no longer
  supports passing the -fobj-arc flag to the linker and will fail to build. The
  addition of this flag was a workaround for a compiler bug in previous versions.
  This flag is no longer included by default - to keep using this flag, you need to
  add `set_arc_compatibility_flag!` to your Podfile.

* [#183](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/183): Fix for
  `.DS_Store` file in `~/.cocoapods` prevents `$ pod install` from running.

* [#134](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/134): Match
  `IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` build setting with `deployment_target` option in
  generated Pods project file.

* [#142](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/): Add `-fobjc-arc` to
  `OTHER_LDFLAGS` if _any_ pods require ARC.

* [#148](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/148): External encoding
  set to UTF-8 on Ruby 1.9 to fix crash caused by non-ascii characters in pod
  description.

* Ensure all header search paths are quoted in the xcconfig file.

* Added weak quoting to `ibtool` input paths.


## 0.5.0 (2011-11-22)

No longer requires MacRuby. Runs on MRI 1.8.7 (OS X system version) and 1.9.3.

A full list of all the changes since 0.3.0 can be found [here][7].


## 0.4.0

Oops, accidentally skipped this version.


## 0.3.0 (2011-11-12)

### Multiple targets

Add support for multiple static library targets in the Pods Xcode project with
different sets of depedencies. This means that you can create a separate
library which contains all dependencies, including extra ones that you only use
in, for instance, a debug or test build. [[docs][1]]

```ruby
# This Podfile will build three static libraries:
# * libPods.a
# * libPods-debug.a
# * libPods-test.a

# This dependency is included in the `default` target, which generates the
# `libPods.a` library, and all non-exclusive targets.
dependency 'SSCatalog'

target :debug do
  # This dependency is only included in the `debug` target, which generates
  # the `libPods-debug.a` library.
  dependency 'CocoaLumberjack'
end

target :test, :exclusive => true do
  # This dependency is *only* included in the `test` target, which generates
  # the `libPods-test.a` library.
  dependency 'Kiwi'
end
```

### Install libraries from anywhere

A dependency can take a git url if the repo contains a podspec file in its
root, or a podspec can be loaded from a file or HTTP location. If no podspec is
available, a specification can be defined inline in the Podfile. [[docs][2]]

```ruby
# From a spec repo.
dependency 'SSToolkit'

# Directly from the Pod’s repo (if it contains a podspec).
dependency 'SSToolkit', :git => 'https://github.com/samsoffes/sstoolkit.git'

# Directly from the Pod’s repo (if it contains a podspec) with a specific commit (or tag).
dependency 'SSToolkit', :git    => 'https://github.com/samsoffes/sstoolkit.git',
                        :commit => '2adcd0f81740d6b0cd4589af98790eee3bd1ae7b'

# From a podspec that's outside a spec repo _and_ the library’s repo. This can be a file or http url.
dependency 'SSToolkit', :podspec => 'https://raw.github.com/gist/1353347/ef1800da9c5f5d267a642b8d3950b41174f2a6d7/SSToolkit-0.1.1.podspec'

# If no podspec is available anywhere, you can define one right in your Podfile.
dependency do |s|
  s.name         = 'SSToolkit'
  s.version      = '0.1.3'
  s.platform     = :ios
  s.source       = { :git => 'https://github.com/samsoffes/sstoolkit.git', :commit => '2adcd0f81740d6b0cd4589af98790eee3bd1ae7b' }
  s.resources    = 'Resources'
  s.source_files = 'SSToolkit/**/*.{h,m}'
  s.frameworks   = 'QuartzCore', 'CoreGraphics'

  def s.post_install(target)
    prefix_header = config.project_pods_root + target.prefix_header_filename
    prefix_header.open('a') do |file|
      file.puts(%{#ifdef __OBJC__\n#import "SSToolkitDefines.h"\n#endif})
    end
  end
end
```

### Add a `post_install` hook to the Podfile class

This allows the user to customize, for instance, the generated Xcode project
_before_ it’s written to disk. [[docs][3]]

```ruby
# Enable garbage collection support for MacRuby applications.
post_install do |installer|
  installer.project.targets.each do |target|
    target.build_configurations.each do |config|
      config.build_settings['GCC_ENABLE_OBJC_GC'] = 'supported'
    end
  end
end
```

### Manifest

Generate a Podfile.lock file next to the Podfile, which contains a manifest of
your application’s dependencies and their dependencies.

```
PODS:
  - JSONKit (1.4)
  - LibComponentLogging-Core (1.1.4)
  - LibComponentLogging-NSLog (1.0.2):
    - LibComponentLogging-Core (>= 1.1.4)
  - RestKit-JSON-JSONKit (0.9.3):
    - JSONKit
    - RestKit (= 0.9.3)
  - RestKit-Network (0.9.3):
    - LibComponentLogging-NSLog
    - RestKit (= 0.9.3)
  - RestKit-ObjectMapping (0.9.3):
    - RestKit (= 0.9.3)
    - RestKit-Network (= 0.9.3)

DOWNLOAD_ONLY:
  - RestKit (0.9.3)

DEPENDENCIES:
  - RestKit-JSON-JSONKit
  - RestKit-ObjectMapping
```

### Generate Xcode projects from scratch

We no longer ship template projects with the gem, but instead generate them
programmatically. This code has moved out into its own [Xcodeproj gem][4],
allowing you to automate Xcode related tasks.
