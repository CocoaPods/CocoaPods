###### __Notice__

At some point in future the master repo will be switched to the YAML format of
specifications. This means that specifications with hooks (or any other kind of
dynamic logic) will not be accepted. Please let us know if there is need for
other DSL attributes or any other kind of support.

Currently the following specifications fail to load as they depended on the
CocoaPods internals and need to be updated:

- LibComponentLogging-pods/0.0.1/LibComponentLogging-pods.podspec
- RestKit/0.9.3/RestKit.podspec
- Three20/1.0.11/Three20.podspec
- ARAnalytics/1.1/ARAnalytics.podspec

Other specifications, might present compatibility issues for the reasons
presented below.

###### __Breaking__

- Subspecs do **not** inherit the files patterns from the parent spec anymore.
  This feature made the implementation more complicated and was not easy to
  explain to podspecs maintainers. Compatibility can be easily fixed by adding
  a 'Core' subspec.
- Support for inline podspecs has been removed.
- The support for Rake::FileList is being deprecated, in favor of a more
  consistent DSL. Rake::FileList also presented issues because it would access
  the file system as soon as it was converted to an array.
- The hooks architecture has been re-factored and might present
  incompatibilities (please open an issue if appropriate).
- The `requires_arc` attribute default value is transitioning from `false` to
  `true`. In the meanwhile a value is needed to pass the lint.
- Deprecated `copy_header_mapping` hook.
- Deprecated `exclude_header_search_paths` attribute.
- External sources are not supported in the dependencies of specifications
  anymore. Actually they never have been supported, they just happened to work.

###### DSL

- Podfile:
  - It is not needed to specify the platform anymore (unless not integrating)
    as CocoaPods now can infer the platform from the integrated targets.
- Specification:
  - `preferred_dependency` has been renamed to `default_subspec`.
  - Added `exclude_files` attribute.
  - Added `screenshots` attribute.
  - Added default values for attributes like `source_files`.

###### Enhancements

- Released preview [documentation](http://docs.cocoapods.org).
- CocoaPods now has support for working in teams and not committing the Pods
  folder, as it will keep track of the status of the Pods folder.
  [#552](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/552)
- Simplified installation: no specific version of ruby gems is required anymore.
- The workspace is written only if needed greatly reducing the occasions in
  which Xcode asks to revert.
- The Lockfile is sorted reducing the SCM noise.
  [#591](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/591)
- Added Podfile, Frameworks, and Resources to the Pods project.
  [#647](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/647)
  [#588](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/588)
- Adds new subcommand `pod spec cat NAME` to print a spec file to standard output.
- Specification hooks are only called when the specification is installed.
- The `--no-clean` option of the `pod spec lint` command now displays the Pods
  project for inspection.
- It is now possible to specify default values for the configuration in
  `~/.cocoapods/config.yaml` ([default values](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/blob/master/lib/cocoapods/config.rb#L17)).
- CocoaPods now checks the checksums of the installed specifications and
  reinstalls them if needed.
- Support for YAML formats of the Podfile and the Specification.
- Added new command `pod ipc` to provide support for inter process
  communication through YAML formats.
- CocoaPods now detects if the folder of a Pod is empty and reinstalls it.
  [#534](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/534)
- Install hooks and the `prefix_header_contents` attribute are supported in subspecs.
  [#617](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/617)
- Dashes are now supported in the versions of the Pods.
  [#293](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/293)

###### Bug fixes

- CocoaPods is not confused anymore by target definitions with different activated subspec.
  [#535](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/535)
- CocoaPods is not confused anymore by to dependencies from external sources.
  [#548](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/548)
- The git cache will always update against the remote if a tag is requested,
  resolving issues where library maintainers where updating the tag after a
  lint and would be confused by CocoaPods using the cached commit for the tag.
  [#407](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/407)
  [#596](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/596)

###### Codebase

###### Bug fixes

- Only flatten tarballs, **not** zipballs, from HTTP sources. A zipball can
  contain single directories in the root that should be preserved, for instance
  a framework bundle. This reverts part of the change in 0.16.1.
  **NOTE** This will break some podspecs that were changed after 0.16.1.
  [#783](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/pull/783)
  [#727](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/727)

###### Bug fixes

- After unpacking source from a HTTP location, move the source into the parent
  dir if the archive contained only one child. This is done to make it
  consistent with how source from other types of locations are described in a
  podspec.
  **NOTE** This might break some podspecs that assumed the incorrect layout.

###### Bug fixes

- In certain conditions the spec of an external would have been overridden
  by the spec in the root of a Pod.
  [#489](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/489)
- CocoaPods now uses a recent version of Octokit.
  [#490](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/490)

###### Bug fixes

- Fix incorrect name for Pods from external sources with preferred subspecs.
  [#485](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/485)
- Prevent duplication of Pod with a local source and mutliple activated specs.
  [#485](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/485)

## 0.14.0.rc1

[CocoaPods](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/compare/0.13.0...0.14.0.rc1) • [Xcodeproj](https://github.com/CocoaPods/Xcodeproj/compare/0.3.1...0.3.2)

###### Enhancements

- Improve installation process by preserving the installed versions of Pods
  across installations and machines. A Pod is reinstalled if:
  - the version required in the Podfile changes and becomes incompatible with
    the installed one.
    [#191](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/191)
  - the external source changes.
  - the head status changes (from disabled to enabled or vice-versa).
- Introduce `pod update` command that installs the dependencies of the Podfile
  **ignoring** the lockfile `Podfile.lock`.
  [#131](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/131)
- Introduce `pod outdated` command that shows the pods with known updates.
- Add `:local` option for dependencies which will use the source files directly
  from a local directory. This is usually used for libraries that are being
  developed in parallel to the end product (application/library).
  [#458](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/458),
  [#415](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/415),
  [#156](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/156).
- Folders of Pods which are no longer required are removed during installation.
  [#298](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/298)
- Add meaningful error messages
  - ia podspec can’t be found in the root of an external source.
    [#385](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/385),
    [#338](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/338),
    [#337](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/337).
  - a subspec name is misspelled.
    [#327](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/327)
  - an unrecognized command and/or argument is provided.
- The subversion downloader now does an export instead of a checkout, which
  makes it play nicer with SCMs that store metadata in each directory.
  [#245](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/245)
- Now the Podfile is added to the Pods project for convenient editing.

###### Bug fixes

- The git cache now fetches the tags from the remote if it can’t find the
  reference.
- Xcodeproj now builds on 10.6.8 and Travis CI without symlinking headers.
- Only try to install, add source files to the project, and clean a Pod once.
  [#376](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/376)

###### Notes

- External Pods might be reinstalled due to the migration to the new
  `Podfile.lock`.
- The SCM reference of head Pods is not preserved across machines.
- Pods whose inline specification changed are not detected as modified. As a
  workaround, remove their folder stored in `Pods`.
- Pods whose specification changed are not detected as modified. As a
  workaround, remove their folder stored in `Pods`.

## 0.6.0

A full list of all the changes since 0.5.1 can be found [here][6].


### Link with specific targets

CocoaPods can now integrate all the targets specified in your `Podfile`.

To specify which target, in your Xcode project, a Pods target should be linked
with, use the `link_with` method like so:

``ruby
platform :ios

workspace 'MyWorkspace'

link_with ['MyAppTarget', 'MyOtherAppTarget']
dependency 'JSONKit'

target :test, :exclusive => true do
  xcodeproj 'TestProject', 'Test' => :debug
  link_with 'TestRunnerTarget'
  dependency 'Kiwi'
end
``

_NOTE: As you can see it can take either one target name, or an array of names._

* If no explicit Xcode workspace is specified and only **one** project exists in
the same directory as the Podfile, then the name of that project is used as the
workspace’s name.

* If no explicit Xcode project is specified for a target, it will use the Xcode
project of the parent target. If no target specifies an expicit Xcode project
and there is only **one** project in the same directory as the Podfile then that
project will be used.

* If no explicit target is specified, then the Pods target will be linked with
the first target in your project. So if you only have one target you do not
need to specify the target to link with.

See [#76](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/76) for more info.

Finally, CocoaPods will add build configurations to the Pods project for all
configurations in the other projects in the workspace. By default the
configurations are based on the `Release` configuration, to base them on the
`Debug` configuration you will have to explicitely specify them as can be seen
above in the following line:

```ruby
xcodeproj 'TestProject', 'Test' => :debug
```


### Documentation

CocoaPods will now generate documentation for every library with the
[`appledoc`][5] tool and install it into Xcode’s documentation viewer.

You can customize the settings used like so:

```ruby
s.documentation = { :appledoc => ['--product-name', 'My awesome project!'] }
```

Alternatively, you can specify a URL where an HTML version of the documentation
can be found:

```ruby
s.documentation = { :html => 'http://example.com/docs/index.html' }
```

See [#149](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/149) and
[#151](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/151) for more info.


### Licenses & Documentation

CocoaPods will now generate two 'Acknowledgements' files for each target specified
in your Podfile which contain the License details for each Pod used in that target
(assuming details have been specified in the Pod spec).

There is a markdown file, for general consumption, as well as a property list file
that can be added to a settings bundle for an iOS application.

You don't need to do anything for this to happen, it should just work.

If you're not happy with the default boilerplate text generated for the title, header
and footnotes in the files, it's possible to customise these by overriding the methods
that generate the text in your `Podfile` like this:

```ruby
class ::Pod::Generator::Acknowledgements
  def header_text
    "My custom header text"
  end
end
```

You can even go one step further and customise the text on a per target basis by
checking against the target name, like this:

```ruby
class ::Pod::Generator::Acknowledgements
  def header_text
    if @target_definition.label.end_with?("MyTargetName")
      "Custom header text for MyTargetName"
    else
      "Custom header text for other targets"
    end
  end
end
```

Finally, here's a list of the methods that are available to override:

```ruby
header_title
header_text
footnote_title
footnote_text
```


### Introduced two new classes: LocalPod and Sandbox.

The Sandbox represents the entire contents of the `POD_ROOT` (normally
`SOURCE_ROOT/Pods`). A LocalPod represents a pod that has been installed within
the Sandbox.

These two classes can be used as better homes for various pieces of logic
currently spread throughout the installation process and provide a better API
for working with the contents of this directory.


### Xcodeproj API

All Xcodeproj APIs are now in `snake_case`, instead of `camelCase`. If you are
manipulating the project from your Podfile's `post_install` hook, or from a
podspec, then update these method calls.


### Enhancements

* [#188](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/pull/188): `list` command now
  displays the specifications introduced in the master repo if it is given as an
  option the number of days to take into account.

* [#188](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/pull/188): Transferred search
  layout improvements and options to `list` command.

* [#166](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/166): Added printing
  of homepage and source to search results.

* [#177](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/177): Added `--stat`
  option to display watchers and forks for pods hosted on GitHub.

* [#177](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/177): Introduced colors
  and tuned layout of search.

* [#112](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/112): Introduced `--push`
  option to `$ pod setup`. It configures the master spec repository to use the private
  push URL. The change is preserved in future calls to `$ pod setup`.

* [#153](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/153): It is no longer
  required to call `$ pod setup`.

* [#163](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/163): Print a template
  for a new ticket when an error occurs.

* Added a new Github-specific downloader that can download repositories as a
  gzipped tarball.

* No more global state is kept during resolving of dependencies.

* Updated Xcodeproj to have a friendlier API.


### Fixes

* [#142](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/142): Xcode 4.3.2 no longer
  supports passing the -fobj-arc flag to the linker and will fail to build. The
  addition of this flag was a workaround for a compiler bug in previous versions.
  This flag is no longer included by default - to keep using this flag, you need to
  add `set_arc_compatibility_flag!` to your Podfile.

* [#183](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/183): Fix for
  `.DS_Store` file in `~/.cocoapods` prevents `$ pod install` from running.

* [#134](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/134): Match
  `IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` build setting with `deployment_target` option in
  generated Pods project file.

* [#142](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/): Add `-fobjc-arc` to
  `OTHER_LD_FLAGS` if _any_ pods require ARC.

* [#148](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/148): External encoding
  set to UTF-8 on Ruby 1.9 to fix crash caused by non-ascii characters in pod
  description.

* Ensure all header search paths are quoted in the xcconfig file.

* Added weak quoting to `ibtool` input paths.


## 0.5.0

No longer requires MacRuby. Runs on MRI 1.8.7 (OS X system version) and 1.9.3.

A full list of all the changes since 0.3.0 can be found [here][7].


## 0.4.0

Oops, accidentally skipped this version.


## 0.3.0

### Multiple targets

Add support for multiple static library targets in the Pods Xcode project with
different sets of depedencies. This means that you can create a separate
library which contains all dependencies, including extra ones that you only use
in, for instance, a debug or test build. [[docs][1]]

```ruby
# This Podfile will build three static libraries:
# * libPods.a
# * libPods-debug.a
# * libPods-test.a

# This dependency is included in the `default` target, which generates the
# `libPods.a` library, and all non-exclusive targets.
dependency 'SSCatalog'

target :debug do
  # This dependency is only included in the `debug` target, which generates
  # the `libPods-debug.a` library.
  dependency 'CocoaLumberjack'
end

target :test, :exclusive => true do
  # This dependency is *only* included in the `test` target, which generates
  # the `libPods-test.a` library.
  dependency 'Kiwi'
end
```

### Install libraries from anywhere

A dependency can take a git url if the repo contains a podspec file in its
root, or a podspec can be loaded from a file or HTTP location. If no podspec is
available, a specification can be defined inline in the Podfile. [[docs][2]]

```ruby
# From a spec repo.
dependency 'SSToolkit'

# Directly from the Pod’s repo (if it contains a podspec).
dependency 'SSToolkit', :git => 'https://github.com/samsoffes/sstoolkit.git'

# Directly from the Pod’s repo (if it contains a podspec) with a specific commit (or tag).
dependency 'SSToolkit', :git    => 'https://github.com/samsoffes/sstoolkit.git',
                        :commit => '2adcd0f81740d6b0cd4589af98790eee3bd1ae7b'

# From a podspec that's outside a spec repo _and_ the library’s repo. This can be a file or http url.
dependency 'SSToolkit', :podspec => 'https://raw.github.com/gist/1353347/ef1800da9c5f5d267a642b8d3950b41174f2a6d7/SSToolkit-0.1.1.podspec'

# If no podspec is available anywhere, you can define one right in your Podfile.
dependency do |s|
  s.name         = 'SSToolkit'
  s.version      = '0.1.3'
  s.platform     = :ios
  s.source       = { :git => 'https://github.com/samsoffes/sstoolkit.git', :commit => '2adcd0f81740d6b0cd4589af98790eee3bd1ae7b' }
  s.resources    = 'Resources'
  s.source_files = 'SSToolkit/**/*.{h,m}'
  s.frameworks   = 'QuartzCore', 'CoreGraphics'

  def s.post_install(target)
    prefix_header = config.project_pods_root + target.prefix_header_filename
    prefix_header.open('a') do |file|
      file.puts(%{#ifdef __OBJC__\n#import "SSToolkitDefines.h"\n#endif})
    end
  end
end
```

### Add a `post_install` hook to the Podfile class

This allows the user to customize, for instance, the generated Xcode project
_before_ it’s written to disk. [[docs][3]]

```ruby
# Enable garbage collection support for MacRuby applications.
post_install do |installer|
  installer.project.targets.each do |target|
    target.build_configurations.each do |config|
      config.build_settings['GCC_ENABLE_OBJC_GC'] = 'supported'
    end
  end
end
```

### Manifest

Generate a Podfile.lock file next to the Podfile, which contains a manifest of
your application’s dependencies and their dependencies.

```
PODS:
  - JSONKit (1.4)
  - LibComponentLogging-Core (1.1.4)
  - LibComponentLogging-NSLog (1.0.2):
    - LibComponentLogging-Core (>= 1.1.4)
  - RestKit-JSON-JSONKit (0.9.3):
    - JSONKit
    - RestKit (= 0.9.3)
  - RestKit-Network (0.9.3):
    - LibComponentLogging-NSLog
    - RestKit (= 0.9.3)
  - RestKit-ObjectMapping (0.9.3):
    - RestKit (= 0.9.3)
    - RestKit-Network (= 0.9.3)

DOWNLOAD_ONLY:
  - RestKit (0.9.3)

DEPENDENCIES:
  - RestKit-JSON-JSONKit
  - RestKit-ObjectMapping
```

### Generate Xcode projects from scratch

We no longer ship template projects with the gem, but instead generate them
programmatically. This code has moved out into its own [Xcodeproj gem][4],
allowing you to automate Xcode related tasks.
