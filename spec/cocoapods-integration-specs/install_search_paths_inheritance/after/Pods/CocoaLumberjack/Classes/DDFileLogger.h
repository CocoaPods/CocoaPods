/**
 *  The LogFileManager protocol is designed to allow you to control all aspects of your log files.
 *
 *  The primary purpose of this is to allow you to do something with the log files after they have been rolled.
 *  Perhaps you want to compress them to save disk space.
 *  Perhaps you want to upload them to an FTP server.
 *  Perhaps you want to run some analytics on the file.
 *
 *  A default LogFileManager is, of course, provided.
 *  The default LogFileManager simply deletes old log files according to the maximumNumberOfLogFiles property.
 *
 *  This protocol provides various methods to fetch the list of log files.
 *
 *  There are two variants: sorted and unsorted.
 *  If sorting is not necessary, the unsorted variant is obviously faster.
 *  The sorted variant will return an array sorted by when the log files were created,
 *  with the most recently created log file at index 0, and the oldest log file at the end of the array.
 *
 *  You can fetch only the log file paths (full path including name), log file names (name only),
 *  or an array of `DDLogFileInfo` objects.
 *  The `DDLogFileInfo` class is documented below, and provides a handy wrapper that
 *  gives you easy access to various file attributes such as the creation date or the file size.
