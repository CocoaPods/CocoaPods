/** A PTPusherChannel object represents a single Pusher channel.

 Channels can be used as a means of filtering or controlling access to events.

 Channels do not need to be explicitly created; they are created on demand. To obtain
 an instance of a PTPusherChannel, you need to subscribe to it first.

 You should not create PTPusherChannel instances directly as they require subscription and
 possibly authorization; you should instead use the subscribeTo methods provided by PTPusher.

 There are three types of channel:

 + Public channels can be subscribed to by anyone who knows their name.

 + Private channels allow you to control access to the data you are broadcasting.

 + Presence channels you to 'register' user information on subscription, and let other members of the channel know who's online.

 Channels can be subscribed to or unsubscribed to at any time, even before the initial
 Pusher connection has been established.

 Generally, channel objects will exist from the point of creation until you explicitly unsubscribe
 from them, unless you maintain your own strong references to the channel object. Channels become
 implicitly unsubscribed when the connection is lost but will be re-subscribed once connection
 is re-established. This means you can use the same channel object across connections.

 See the README for more information on channel object lifetime.

 If you attempt to trigger event on a channel while isSubscribed is NO, the event will not be sent.

 If the event name does not have a prefix of "client-", it will be added automatically.

 it could be a simple string.

 Presence channels build on the security of Private channels and expose the additional feature
 of an awareness of who is subscribed to that channel. This makes it extremely easy to build
 chat room and "who's online" type functionality to your application.

 Presence channel names always have the prefix of "presence-".

 Unlike the Pusher Javascript client API, PTPusherPresenceChannel does not use events to notify
 when members are added or removed. Instead, you should assign a presenceDelegate which will
 be notified of these events.
