Only beta builds will notify users about a new version  NOTE: You will need to add a dependency on JSONKit, SBJson or YAJL yourself. If you want the framework to try again when a network is available, add a dependency on Reachability and send a notification with the name `BITHockeyNetworkDidBecomeReachable` yourself when the network becomse reachable.",
