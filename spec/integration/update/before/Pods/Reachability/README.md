This is Apple’s [example code][apple] of the SystemConfiguration Reachability
APIs, adapted by [Andrew Donoho][donoho], split-off from the
[ASIHTTPRequest source][asi].

### This code needs an actual maintainer.

It is currently only on the CocoaPods gihub account, because ASIHTTPRequest
(which has afaik the most up-to-date version) is no longer actively maintained.

If you use Reachability and/or would like to step-up as the maintainer, please
contact us and we’ll gladly hand over this repository to you.

Also see the [TODO][todo].
