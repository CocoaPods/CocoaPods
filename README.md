### CocoaPods: The Objective-C dependency manager

CocoaPods manages dependencies for your Xcode projects.

You specify the dependencies for your project in one easy text file. CocoaPods
resolves dependencies between libraries, fetches source code for the
dependencies, and creates and maintains an Xcode workspace to build your
project.

Ultimately, the goal is to improve discoverability of, and engagement in, third
party open-source libraries, by creating a more centralized ecosystem.

Installing and updating CocoaPods is very easy. Don't miss the [Installation
guide](http://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html#installation) and the
[Getting started guide](http://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).
