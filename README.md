CocoaPods manages library dependencies for your Xcode project.

You specify the dependencies for your project in one easy text file. CocoaPods
resolves dependencies between libraries, fetches source code for the
dependencies, and creates and maintains an Xcode workspace to build your
project.

Ultimately, the goal is to improve discoverability of, and engagement in, third
party open-source libraries, by creating a more centralized ecosystem.

Installing and updating CocoaPods is very easy. Don't miss the [Installation
guide](http://docs.cocoapods.org/guides/installing_cocoapods.html) and the
[Getting started guide](http://docs.cocoapods.org/guides/getting_started.html).
See the [NSScreencast](https://twitter.com/NSScreencast) episode about [using
CocoaPods](http://nsscreencast.com/episodes/5-cocoapods) for a quick overview.

## Collaborate

All CocoaPods development happens on GitHub, contributions make good karma and
we welcome with joy new contributors.

# Donations

- [@fngtps](http://twitter.com/fngtps) is donating time to work on the design
  of the forthcoming cocoapods.org website and donated the money to hire [Max
  Steenbergen](http://twitter.com/maxsteenbergen) to design [an
  icon](http://drbl.in/cpmL) for it.
- [@sauspiel](http://twitter.com/Sauspiel) uses CocoaPods for their games and
  have hired me to add features and specs they needed. These are Nimbus,
  QuincyKit, and HockeyKit. For the [Nimbus
  spec](https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs/blob/master/Nimbus/0.9.0/Nimbus.podspec),
  the ‘subspecs’ feature was added.
